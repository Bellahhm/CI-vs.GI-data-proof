On 4th April, H.E. Ambassador Liu Jin awarded Chinese Ambassador's Scholarship to 30 academically outstanding UTG students. An awarding ceremony was held in the Law Faculty Auditorium at UTG Kanifing campus, attended by UTG Vice Chancellor Prof. Herbert Robinson, Deputy Vice Chancellor Prof. Momodou Jain, Chinese Dean of UTG Confucius institute, UTG faculty and management staff, beneficiaries of the scholarship and UTG students.

H.E. Ambassador Liu congratulated the awardees on winning the scholarship, a program that has been implemented annually since 2017 for supporting UTG students' academic pursuits, and assisting the UTG in fostering The Gambia's brainpower for achieving national development goals. H.E. Ambassador Liu comprehensively explained the blueprint for China's development enacted by the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), focusing on answering three questions: What is the major task for the Chinese government and people? What does China hope the world and Africa to develop into? What is the future of China-Gambia relations? H.E. Ambassador Liu said that The 20th National Congress of CPC drew up a grand blueprint for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. Chinese modernization is socialist modernization pursued under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. It contains elements that are common to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the Chinese context. The Chinese path to modernization can provide references and options for other developing countries to explore their own paths to modernization. H.E. Ambassador Liu introduced the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind, the Belt and Road Initiative, the common values of humanity, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. Reviewing the fruitful results of China-Africa and China-Gambia cooperation in various fields in recent years, H.E. Ambassador Liu said that this year marks the 10th anniversary of principles of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith and a commitment to the greater good and shared interests proposed by President Xi Jinping. China will continue to uphold these principles and cooperate with The Gambia and other African countries to further deepen cooperation, achieve mutual benefit and win-win results, and jointly build a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era. H.E. Ambassador Liu encouraged UTG students to continue working hard, and broaden their horizons, make good use of platforms such as the Confucius institute at the UTG to learn about Chinese culture, and become ambassadors of friendship between China and The Gambia.

Vice Chancellor Prof. Robinson spoke highly of Gambia-China relations and thanked the Chinese government for providing support for the development of The Gambia's education, especially for providing training and capacity building opportunities for UTG students and faculty. UTG has become an important platform for scientific, educational and cultural exchanges between The Gambia and China, and is willing to contribute to Gambia-China friendship.

Prior to the ceremony, H.E. Ambassador Liu called on Vice Chancellor Prof. Robinson at his office. They exchanged views on further promoting cooperation.

SARGODHA -- The University of Sargodha (UoS) and the Confucius institute of the university jointly organised an event in connection with the Chinese new year celebrations, here on Saturday.

The Chinese new year is one of the most important event in the lives of the Chinese people as it takes place with the arrival of spring season and is also known as Spring Festival, a time for the reunion of families and friends with festive atmosphere. In the Chinese lunar calendar, there are 12 years and each year is depicted by an animal like rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and boar. This year, starting from January 22, is the year of rabbit.

Director Confucius institute Jane Chen, in his introductory remarks, said that the Chinese people practise the new year traditions since ancient times. She shared information about the traditions of Chinese new year celebrations. She said the Chinese people celebrate the new year with customs and traditions such as making couplets and decorating their houses, preparing special foods such as dumplings and fish which symbolise money and wealth, using firecrackers to celebrate, family and friends reunions and paying new year visits to the loved ones.

Miss Jessica, the Chinese language teacher, shared the information about the traditional event of paper-cutting. She also shared the motives behind this traditional event that Chinese people use paper-cutting as a way to express their feelings of joy and happiness. She said that paper-cutting could be of any shape like paper-cutting of Chinese zodiac animals, children, flowers or any Chinese character. She also performed the activity with the students where students learned paper-cutting of the Chinese character 'chun'.

Dr Cao taught the pronunciation of expressions for blessings that are used at Chinese Spring Festival. He also taught students about how to make couplets.

Director PICS Dr. Fazlur Rahman, in his concluding remarks, highlighted the importance of the culture in everyday life and advised students to learn the Chinese language wholeheartedly to get to know the Chinese culture, traditions and history. He emphasised that the 21st Century belongs to China as a leading progressive and cooperating power.

MEMBERS from the Chinese community hopped into the Year of the Rabbit with a sparkling Spring Festival Carnival, featuring traditional dances, workshops and a martial arts display.

The event and gala dinner was set up by the Bahrain University Confucius institute at Bahrain Polytechnic in Isa Town to celebrate the Chinese lunar New Year.

The Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival in China, is the most important time of year for family gatherings and one of the world's largest festivities to herald the entrance of spring.

According to Bahrain University Confucius institute director Dr Qianwen Zhou, members of the community could not wait to commemorate the event in the kingdom.

"We really wanted to have a festival and many Chinese living in Bahrain, as well as people of different nationalities who love Chinese culture, attended it," said Dr Qianwen. "We showcased cultural activities and had stalls featuring Chinese businesses. It was supported by the Chinese Embassy in Bahrain and several Chinese companies."

Chinese Embassy chargé d'affaires Qin Liu was delighted to be at the festival along with invited guests and dignitaries.

"In the past three years, because of the pandemic, we were unable to get together to celebrate the Chinese Spring Festival," she told GulfWeekly.

"We enjoyed each other's company and were happy to see many of our Bahraini friends joining us as well. This is a very good time to get to know Chinese culture because this is the Year of the Rabbit, which means kindness, purity and agility."

Each year represents a different animal and the cycle is repeated every 12 years. The 12 animals are the mouse, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.

"The Year of the Rabbit indicates that the New Year will be a good and happy one," added Qin Liu. "We wish our friends from China and Bahrain all the best and good health in the Year of the Rabbit."

During the festival, people of different ages, nationalities and backgrounds visited stands including the Chinese language-learning table or the Tai Chi martial arts section, while others enjoyed the variety of workshops.

Members of the Third Bahrain Sea Scouts, made up of nine youngsters aged 10 to 14 and their scout leaders, were excited to attend.

"We wanted to learn about a different culture and one of our leaders also studies at the Polytechnic," said Brazilian scout leader Francine Pinhal, 39, who is a chef at a food factory in Janabiyah. "We wanted to join in their festivities."

A group of women made fresh traditional dumplings for visitors to savour while 35-year-old Chinese businessman Bing You from Muharraq took part in the Lion Dance and showcased the traditional bamboo brush calligraphy writing to visitors.

"Ancient Chinese students and masters used this brush before the invention of the pen," he said. "It ranges in size and everyone had a different style of writing using an array of brush strokes."

Three University of Bahrain students - Omar Abu Bakr, 19, pursuing electrical engineering, Sami Al Ashkar, 21, from computer engineering and Mohammed Ahmed, 19, who is doing computer science - showcased the dragon dance.

Dancing dragons can vary in size and length and are believed to bring luck to people. The longer the creature, the more luck it will bring, and if touched, it means good fortune and prosperity will be coming up. The dance is accompanied by the intense and mesmerising rhythm of cymbals, gongs and the big drum.

The three friends are also part of the university's Chinese Club. "It's fun to hang out and get to know new people," said Omar from Hamad Town. "It's a vibe and we had such a good time."

Another folksy practice is the Chinese tea ceremony, which has been integral to Chinese culture for centuries.

Chinese teacher and tea expert, Yanan Zhang, 31, from A'ali, demonstrated her knowledge of tea with a performance. "Tea was used as a medicine a long time ago and there are many benefits for the hot drink as well," she said.

In ancient China, tea represented elegance, harmony, friendliness and grace.

Yanan added that this was an auspicious day and that she was really happy other nationalities shared in the celebration.

"I am very happy when people want to learn about our culture and I wish everyone a XinniÈín kuàilè (Happy New Year)," Yanan said.

The Chinese and Korean communities in Bahrain and around the world are commemorating the arrival of the Year of the Rabbit.

Chinese expatriates have organised a Spring Festival Carnival, which will feature traditional dances, calligraphy workshops and a martial arts display.

Set up by the Bahrain University Confucius institute, today's festival and gala event will be hosted at Bahrain Polytechnic, Isa Town from 4pm to 8pm.

"The lunar new year is the most celebrated event in China," Bahrain University Confucius institute director Dr Qianwen Zhou told the GDN.

"The Spring Festival Carnival, which will be home to numerous cultural activities, is supported by the Chinese Embassy in Bahrain and several Chinese companies."

Korean New Year or 'Seollal', falling on January 22 this year, is also a festival and national holiday.

It is a cultural event too, which has its roots in traditional Chinese Confucianism and is celebrated on the first day of the Korean lunar calendar. It usually lasts three days -- the day before, New Year itself, and the day after.

Hae Kwan Chung, ambassador of the Republic of Korea, told the GDN of the importance of the event to his country and added: "It is a special celebration where families get together and exchange presents."

Each year represents a different animal and the cycle is repeated every 12 years. The 12 animals are the mouse, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. The order of the animals is thought to have been based on the sequence in which they were invited to see Buddha, believers say.

Many Koreans are convinced that the animal representing the year that a baby is born may attribute certain characters and qualities to that baby. There are even some parents who plan the birth year of their children in accordance with this belief.

2023 is the Year of the Rabbit -- 'a kind, energetic and resilient animal' that represents patience and treating others with respect.

The rabbit is the symbol of longevity, peace and prosperity in Chinese culture, thus 2023 is predicted to be a year of hope.

As Chinese shoppers trickle back to tourist hotspots for Lunar New Year holidays, malls aim to lure them into stores with red lantern displays, special dances to mark the Year of the Rabbit and discounts, Reuters reports.

The overall number of international flights from China is still just 12 per cent of pre-pandemic levels due to slow capacity increases. But retailers in popular destinations are desperate to take advantage of the return of a first wave of Chinese tourists as the country reopens borders after three long years of Covid-19 curbs.

As well as malls, most Asian restaurants across the kingdom are also marking the occasion too with special menus and celebrations.

In obedience to tradition and a sense of true patriotism, the Confucius institute of the state-run University of Liberia (CIUL) at the weekend held an elaborate program in commemoration of the Chinese Springs Festival otherwise known as the Chinese New Year.

Chinese New Year, also called Lunar New Year, is an annual 15-day festival in China and Chinese communities around the world that begins with the new moon that occurs sometime between January 21 and February 20 according to Western calendars. Festivities last until the following full moon.

The holiday is sometimes called the Lunar New Year because the dates of celebration follow the phases of the moon. Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general.

Here in Liberia, the festival was organized by authorities of the Confucius institute and was attended by students of the institute at the 13th Street staff compound.

During the occasion, Madam Zhou Hongzhuan, Director of CIUL, explained to students the importance of the Spring Festival to China and its people.

She drilled the students and guests through the many "remarkable" activities that are carried out to befit the celebration. She named some of those key activities as spring cleaning, paper cutting, sprint couplet, family reunion dinner, firing of firecrackers among others.

Madam Zhou indicated that these celebrations are done to usher out the old year and bring forth the luck and prosperity of the new one.

Comparatively, the CIUL Director likened the celebration of the Spring Festival with Christmas Day of the West.

"The Spring Festival is the most important festival for the Chinese people and is a time when all family members get together, just like Christmas in the West," indicated Director Zhou.

Meanwhile, the origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years ago a monster named Nian ("Year") would attack villagers at the beginning of each New Year. During this time, young people are given money in colorful red envelopes. In addition, Chinese New Year is a time to feast and to visit family members. Many traditions of the season honor relatives who have died.

The team leader, Dr Zhou Haijiang performed various TCM therapies, including acupuncture, cupping, massotherapy and scrapping, as well as the eight Chinese fitness exercises, to the keen students and explained how TCM is intertwined historically with Chinese culture.

The attack that took place in Karachi's Saddar area on Wednesday, where a Chinese national was shot dead and two others were injured after an unidentified assailant opened fire inside a dental clinic, is part of a formidable dark agenda instigated by non-state actors against Pakistan's foreign policy. These attacks must not be seen in isolation-Chinese citizens have been consistently targeted this year by anti-Pakistan elements. The most notable attack, which sent shockwaves across the country, remains the horrific suicide bombing in the Confucius institute at Karachi University in May; but there have been several other incidents this year targeting Chinese citizens, amplifying the need to increase protection for workers and those involved in CPEC.

After the first attack in May, China and Pakistan's foreign ministers released statements saying that China and Pakistan were committed to thwarting any attempts, including terrorism instigated by external actors, to undermine bilateral ties, and with regards to the attack on Chinese nationals, both countries would take firm and effective measures to deal with it. Those promises and resolve appear unreliable when these incidents, like the one that took place on Wednesday, continue to happen. This lapse in security seems even more incriminating considering a previous incident of violence against Chinese citizens occurred earlier in the year at the very same place, Saddar, Karachi.

PMD predicts dry weather in most parts of country

The sole purpose of these attacks is to weaken Pakistan. These consistent attempts to target Chinese nationals and disrupt progress in the country are evidence that a larger game to disrupt the country's development and harm relationships is at play. The authorities must take note of the new insidious ways with which these non-state actors are trying to sabotage CPEC and threaten the stability and peace of the country. We need to invest in better security-and security does not just mean physical guarding forces around foreign residents in Pakistan, but better intelligence gathering and working on eliminating sleeper cells from urban centres.

Alleged terrorist had got a new identification very easily, according to the probe. 'The terror suspect had got himself registered with a new name in another family,' sources said.

'A man Abdul Rehman had declared Dad Bakhsh as his brother,' sources said. 'Dad Bakhsh got new identification with the name of Shoaib after NADRA registration'. 'The law enforcers are collecting details of Abdul Rehman, who had declared Dad Bakhsh as his brother,' sources said.

Invited by the Confucius institute of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, the Consul General in Shanghai, David Gamarra, gave a videoconference, which first addressed the old friendship between the peoples of Peru and China, and later the protocols and measures that are suggested to be followed to conduct safe business with Chinese counterparts.

In this sense, special emphasis was placed on the essential minimum guarantees that must be followed when conducting digital business, which is the most common way in which these transactions are currently carried out as a result of the limitations imposed by the Covid pandemic. For this, legal ways were presented by which Chinese counterparts can prove the legal existence of their companies, as well as that of their representatives and thus conduct safe business.

The auditorium was made up of students and professors from that house of studies.
32Pakistan's quick handling of the case of attack on the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi reflects the importance the country attaches to the security of Chinese nationals.

The incident will not hinder the progress of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in Pakistan but instead will cement the joint efforts of China and Pakistan in fighting against terrorism and enhance cooperation in safeguarding regional security, experts said.

On April 26, a suicide attack in Karachi killed four people including three Chinese nationals, who were teaching staff at the Confucius institute at Karachi University and a local driver.

For such a complex case, the Pakistani government acted quickly in terms of investigating and apprehending, Zhu Yongbiao, a professor at the Lanzhou University's Research Center for the Belt and Road, told the Global Times, noting that the case was not a traditional terrorist attack case, but one that involved masterminds, attack initiators, brainwashing and indirect control behind the scenes.

The ongoing threat to Pakistan's security situation and the terrorist organization's complex structure and operations has added difficulty to solving the case, Zhu said.

"The arrest and briefing reflect the importance the Pakistani government attaches to the security of Chinese nationals in that country," Zhu said.

Zhu noted that the Chinese are easily seen as targets mainly because the terrorists believes that attacks on Chinese can threaten the Pakistani government they oppose, and that attacks on foreign targets are more likely to draw international backlash than attacks on local targets in an attempt to force concessions from the government.

"However, the security situation for Chinese has improved since the April case," Zhu said.

"The Pakistani government has increased its security presence, and China has increased protection, reminders and training for businesses and employees. Affected by the incident, Chinese citizens have also become more conscious of security issues."

Zhu pointed out that the interference of external forces in Pakistan is a long-standing problem, involving multiple factors from Western countries and India.

"While strengthening the fight against terrorism, the direction of public opinion needs to be guided to avoid negative propaganda," Zhu told Global Times.

"China will also work hard to ensure that projects invested in Pakistan can better benefit local people, so that they understand and support China-Pakistan cooperation."

The international community should also be on the side of justice and treat counterterrorism efforts equally without double standards. Countries should stop using support for terrorism or extremism as a political tool, Zhu said.

In a recent interview with the Global Times, Pakistan Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque also noted that Pakistan and China are aware of threats coming from external forces that attempt to undermine China-Pakistan friendship. "We are working together to destroy these forces who are against our future."

He noted that the case was not a traditional terrorist attack case, but one that involved masterminds, attack initiators, brainwashing and indirect control behind the scenes.

Zhu noted that the Chinese are easily seen as targets mainly because the terrorists believes that attacks on Chinese can threaten the Pakistani government they oppose, and that attacks on foreign targets are more likely to draw international backlash than attacks on local targets in an attempt to force concessions from the government.

"However, the security situation for Chinese has improved since the April case," Zhu said. "The Pakistani government has increased its security presence, and China has increased protection, reminders and training for businesses and employees. Affected by the incident, Chinese citizens have also become more conscious of security issues."

Zhu pointed out that the interference of external forces in Pakistan is a long-standing problem, involving multiple factors from Western countries and India.

"While strengthening the fight against terrorism, the direction of public opinion needs to be guided to avoid negative propaganda," Zhu said.

"China will also work hard to ensure that projects invested in Pakistan can better benefit local people, so that they understand and support China-Pakistan cooperation."

The international community should also be on the side of justice and treat counterterrorism efforts equally without double standards. Countries should stop using support for terrorism or extremism as a political tool, Zhu said.

China has appreciated the arrest of key suspect involved in the terrorist attack on the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi by Pakistani authorities. Addressing regular briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian expressed his firm resolve to continue support to Pakistan in anti-terror combat.

The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Tuesday produced the alleged mastermind of the Karachi University suicide bombing before an anti-terrorism court (ATC). The suspect was netted by the CTD with the technical assistance of other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) on Monday. The CTD police informed the judge that the suspect was a commander of separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Federation-Karachi (BLF) and the mastermind of attack on the Chinese teachers outside the KU's Confucius institute in April this year.

Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the suspect, Dad Bakhsh, was arrested from Mauripur Road, Hawkesbay. He said the suspect made major revelations during the interrogation. The suspect joined BLF in 2013 and led several attacks on the security forces in Balochistan.

He said the suspect fled to a neighboring country in 2017 after being exposed and came back to Karachi later.

The suspect said the KU blast was a joint terrorist activity by the BLF and BLA, the minister said.

Memon said the suspect was a commander of BLF sleeper cell in Karachi and had been surveying different targets as per the directives of BLA Commander Khalil Baloch. These targets included sensitive installations and Chinese teachers, he said, says a news report. Memon said the suspect revealed that he met Shari's husband Haibtan and another dangerous terrorist named Zaib, who he said was the mastermind of the KU attack. "Bakhsh entered Pakistan through a neighboring country and started living with Haibtan and Shari in their Delhi Colony flat," Memon said.

He said the suspect fled to Balochistan on the orders of Khalil Baloch after the attack, while Zeb was at the university at the time of the attack. "He entered KU before Shari and exited immediately after the blast," Memon quoted the suspect as saying during interrogations.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

The minister further stated that the suspect revealed that Zaib trained him in making IEDs at Majeed Brigade headquarters at the BLA and BLF camp in the 'neighboring country'.

He said the LEAs and CTD had made progress in the case together and more leads will follow soon.

Memon also informed the media about extraordinary findings of the probe including increase in the use of women and children in terrorist activities, efforts to make women and students an agent of the terrorist organizations, efforts to create chaos in the society and declare Pakistan a failed state by fueling reactions against specific communities, and training of youngsters and exploitation of psychologically insecure women. The case of Shari is under study by psychological experts which found that Shari was also exploited psychologically. On Monday, a 13-member Chinese delegation led by China's counter-terrorism deputy director-general, GaoFei, met Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and Sindh Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon. The officials discussed the security of Chinese nationals working in the province and progress in investigation in the suicide bombing.

In April, four people, including three Chinese nationals, were killed, while four others sustained injuries in a car explosion on the premises of the University of Karachi. According to the CTD, it was a suicide bombing carried out by a burqa-clad woman, who was later identified as Shari Baloch. The deceased Chinese nationals were identified as the director of the Confucius institute Huang Guiping, Ding Mupeng, Chen Sai, and their Pakistani driver, Khalid. Police sources said the van entered the premises through the Maskan gate of the university.

Memon said all terrorists who join such organizations and try to destabilize Pakistan with the help of other countries "want to stop foreign investment from coming in". "Work is underway on different projects.

Important schemes such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) are underway with the help of brotherly nations like China. These terrorist organizations, with their nefarious designs and a foreign agenda, want to destabilize the country. They want to give the message that Pakistan is not safe for foreign investment."

He vowed that terrorist organizations trying to create unrest would be eliminated by the country's security agencies. Responding to a question, Memon said that the terrorists involved in the attack had foreign assistance but it would not be apt to name at country involved at this stage as the investigation was still ongoing. "But whichever country is involved [-] our work is to trace and give strict punishment to those involved and give the message that nobody can cast a dirty eye on Pakistan." He said that the country in question would be conveyed a message at the government level in line with diplomatic norms that their land was being used for terrorist activities. "I don't think it is appropriate to name any country," he said.

On May 11, 2022, when State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a video meeting with Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal, they exchanged views on the safety of Chinese citizens in Pakistan and reached a consensus.

Wang Yi pointed out that after the terrorist attack on the shuttle bus of the Confucius institute at Karachi University on April 26, the Pakistani President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Parliament, leaders of various parties and people from all walks of life condemned the terrorist attack unanimously. Prime Minister Shabazz and you came to China as soon as possible. The embassy in Pakistan expressed condolences and sent a letter to Chinese leaders to express condolences. The Pakistani cabinet also decided to enhance the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan to an unprecedented level. China fully affirms this.

Wang Yi emphasized that in the past period of time, Pakistan has successively carried out terrorist attacks against Chinese personnel in Pakistan, causing serious casualties. The purpose of terrorist forces is to weaken the credibility of the Pakistani government and to undermine the traditional friendship between China and Pakistan. Both sides should take immediate action and take firm and effective measures to deal with it. The most urgent task is to speed up the investigation and pursuit of the culprit and punish them as soon as possible. The two sides should improve the security protection of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan in a targeted manner, provide timely security warnings, and plug security loopholes. It is hoped that the Pakistani side will speed up the implementation of the "Enhanced Work Plan for Safeguarding the Safety of Chinese Personnel, Institutions and Projects in Pakistan", effectively ensure the safety of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan, and resolutely prevent similar incidents from happening again. China will continue to support Pakistan in enhancing its counter-terrorism capabilities, and is willing to work with Pakistan to resolutely thwart all attempts to undermine China-Pakistan relations.

Bilawal said that the Pakistani side strongly condemns the terrorist attack on the Confucius institute in Karachi. An attack on our Chinese brothers and sisters is an attack on the Palestinian people. Pakistan firmly opposes all terrorist acts, and will definitely investigate the case and bring all criminals to justice. The terrorists' target is Pakistan-China friendship, and the Pakistani side will never let them succeed. Pakistani intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies are working around the clock to do everything in their power to punish criminals and to prevent similar incidents from happening again. China is Pakistan's best friend, and the Pakistani side is willing to further enhance its anti-terrorism capability to ensure the safety of all Chinese citizens in Pakistan.

The April 26 suicide bombing on a van near the Confucius institute at the Karachi University, killing three Chinese academics, came as a yet another shock, though not unsurprising. Understandably, China's Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the attack, 'demanded' Pakistan punish the perpetrators, protect Chinese citizens and prevent such incidents from happening again. 'The blood of the Chinese people should not be shed in vain, and those behind this incident will surely pay the price,' it said in a statement.

This strong-worded message prompted speculation as to how annoyed the Chinese were on the latest loss of three of their citizens. But they are not oblivious either to China-focused acts of terror across Pakistan. Nor do they lack understanding on the dynamics of this kind of terror, particularly in areas where CPEC development projects are underway.

That is why the statement by a spokesperson within 48 hours of the initial response was much more measured and reflective of the nature of challenges flowing from geopolitics for both China and Pakistan.

'The Pakistani side is going all out to investigate and hunt down the perpetrators... I want to stress that terrorism is the common enemy of all humanity. China and Pakistan are resolved and able to keep terrorists at bay and make them pay the price,' Wang Wenbin, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, told a media briefing.

In fact the spokesperson reiterated as to how Beijing plans to take the bilateral relationship forward.

'China has always supported Pakistan's national development. We will continue to support Pakistan's economic and social development and improvement of people's livelihood. The Pakistani government has pledged to strengthen security for Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan and not to allow any force to undermine the great China-Pakistan friendship and cooperation. We believe that the Pakistani side will earnestly take robust measures to ensure that China-Pakistan cooperation moves ahead in a safe and smooth manner,' Wenbin said.

Officials also underlined that any attempt to undermine China-Pakistan friendship and cooperation will be thwarted by the Chinese and Pakistani people. 'We would also like to remind Chinese citizens, institutions, projects and personnel in Pakistan to take extra security precautions and pay close attention to security risks,' the foreign ministry in Beijing said.

Chinese officials also realise that the Baloch insurgency is not a low-intensity conflict anymore because of its possible links to proxy terrorism directed at China and its allies. Baloch militants have been tactfully targeting Chinese interests in Karachi, Gwadar and elsewhere. Back in August 2018, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists targeted the Chinese consulate in Karachi, followed by a similar attack in 2020 at the Pakistan Stock Exchange where the Chinese have major investments - nearly 40 per cent in terms of share-holding, according to some estimates.

The obvious objective is to shake the financial and trading nerve centre of Pakistan, mostly through suicide bombings. And this time the BLA engaged a female bomber. This indicates the terrorists' strategy is also evolving with the passage of time, particularly after the alliance with the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which introduced the fidayeen (suicide-bombers) attacks into the BLA tactics.

No surprise that the nexus between BLA, BNA (Baloch Nationalist Army) and TTP emerged stronger after the Afghan Taliban's return to Kabul in August last year. At the core of the anti-China attacks is the Majeed Brigade of BLA - a unit which recruits, trains and produces fidayeen for the Baloch separatist movements and has claimed responsibility for all the three strikes in Karachi. While trying their best to endear local populations through community-focused work in various parts of Balochistan, Chinese officials and their companies view these outfits as instruments of proxy terrorism and hence not inclined to squarely blame Pakistan alone.

That the Chinese leadership is seized with the worrying consequences of geopolitics (Ukraine war and the US projection of China's emergence as a big challenge to the US interests) is also evident from an initiative that President Xi Jinping unveiled in his keynote speech via video on April 25 at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022. President Xi introduced his vision of upholding 'common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable' security for all and underlined that the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously and that no country's security should be built at the cost of others' security.

Following up on the initiative, Foreign Minister Wang Yi wrote in an oped that Xi's vision contributes Chinese wisdom to addressing the peace deficit of humanity and coping with global security challenges, and his initiative meets the common aspirations of countries around the world to uphold multilateralism and safeguard international solidarity.

The Chinese resolve to stay on in Pakistan should, nevertheless, not deflect officials from addressing longstanding simmering issues such as under-development in Balochistan, alleged human rights violations, unemployment and missing persons. We need to openly address them in an inclusive way to forestall unnecessary speculation and criticism.

A special fund was given by the Chinese International Education Foundation for rehabilitation of the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi, Pakistan, in the wake of the terrorist attack on its shuttle bus killing three Chinese last week.

According to Global Times, the fund of 500,000 yuan ($75,660) on April 30 will also be used to offer relief to the victims and their families.

Academic peace was thrown to wind as terrorists struck the Confucius institute inside the Karachi University on Tuesday. It was reportedly a suicide blast that targeted a van carrying the staff of the institute. Four people, including three Chinese nationals, were killed in the attack. Two bystanders were also critically injured in what seems to be a shocking incident, as many are not even aware of the Beijing-run institute in the campus. This hints at a well-orchestrated plot to not only shatter the uneasy peace in the biggest metropolitan city but also to sow seeds of dissent with China, which has been at the vanguard of socio-economic development in Pakistan.

A proscribed entity, the Baloch Liberation Army, has staked its claim, but little is known about its veracity. This highly condemnable terrorist attack once again draws the attention towards the bitter fact that not much has been done to mop the society of disgruntled elements. Nefarious and shady characters that thrive on the philosophy of otherness are very much around, and unfortunately find refuge under ethnic, lingual, sectarian and political umbrellas. Moreover, the tendency to target Chinese nationals and assets especially that pertain to CPEC is remorseful and calls for a zero-tolerance retaliatory strategy.

The KU blast has some missing dots to connect. A log from the security adviser of the campus brings to the fore a well-documented concern that movement of foreign nationals without security detail is worrisome. The official concerned had flagged the Confucius institute authorities about it, too. While the biggest academic campus in Pakistan is under the firm eyes of paramilitary forces for the last three decades, this incident is simply unacceptable. It confirms a serious security lapse, and is in need of being probed.

This unfortunate incident seems to be a continuation of vendetta acts, wherein a particular lobby is out to defame Pakistan. Similar back to back attacks in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces against Chinese engineers and staff in the yester-months point to a master plan against national security. The culprits, abettors and their white-collared patrons must be screened and punished.
73

Talking to media after visiting the blast site, the acting VC said that the attack on a van outside Confucius institute cannot be blamed for poor security.

She said that all foreign faculty members are escorted by Rangers personnel whenever they commute to and from the university.

The acting VC said that such cowardly and nefarious attempts to undermine Pak-China friendship will not be allowed to succeed under any circumstances.

The horrific attack targeting a van carrying Chinese academics near the Confucius institute in Karachi University has sent shockwaves across the country particularly because it reflects a new, more brutal wave of terror attacks. It is a rare instance of an attack on Chinese nationals allegedly carried out by a female suicide bomber. The profile of the alleged culprit-a mother with two degrees from an educated, well-off family, bellies the traditional image of a militant, and indicates a dangerous new turn in terrorism tactics.

This attack should be a wake-up call on how deep anti-state elements have been rooted that they are able to now brainwash and train ordinary women into becoming suicide bombers. A background check of the history of the alleged culprit indicates that she had been inculcated into the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a terrorist group, specifically the Majeed Brigade group, indicating that these foreign-funded terrorist factors are targeting university students into becoming militants.

The sole purpose of this attack was to weaken Pakistan. The BLA's consistent attempts to target Chinese nationals and disrupt progress in the country clearly show that the interests of the province are not what they are fighting for; rather it is evident that a larger game to disrupt the country's development and harm relationships is at play. The BLA's terrorist activities are different from some legitimate grievances of the Baloch people, grievances which have often been addressed to and listened to by the Pakistani state. This malicious attack, with its roots in non-state funding, only causes damage to the Baloch people, and the use of women as suicide bombers reflects an alarming revelation of how far these non-state actors are willing to go to cause discord in Pakistan. The authorities must take note of the new insidious ways with which these non-state actors are trying to sabotage CPEC and threaten the stability and peace of the country.

Islamabad: Three Chinese citizens and their Pakistani driver were killed and four more people were wounded in an explosion that ripped through a van inside a university campus in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi on Tuesday. Separatist group Balochistan National Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out by a woman suicide bomber. Karachi University (KU) spokesperson Muhammad Farooq said the victims were identified as Huang Guiping, director of the Chinese-built Confucius institute, Ding Mupeng, Chen Sai and Khalid, the driver. ôA fourth Chinese national, Wang Yuqing, and Pakistani guard Hamid were among the wounded.ö Television footage showed a white van in flames with plumes of smoke rising from it after the blast. The vehicle appeared to be turning towards Confucius institute, a Chinese language teaching centre at KU located next to the commerce department, when the blast happened. Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon said CCTV footage showed a person covered from head-to-toe in a burqa walking up to the van, followed by an explosion around 2.30pm. According to police, about 3-4 kg of explosives were packed in aschoolbag with ball bearings. ôThe material does not seem to be made locally,ö said Raja Umar Khattab, chief of Karachi's counterterrorism department. The separatist BLA's statement identified the bomber as Shari Baluch or Bramsh, saying she was the group's first woman bomber. The attack marks ôa new chapter in the history of Baluch resistance,ö it said. Balochistan has long been the scene of low-level insurgency by armed Baloch groups demanding more autonomy and a greater share in the region's natural resources if not outright independence from Pakistan. The separatists as well as Pakistani Taliban had frequently targeted Chinese interests across the country in the past. Last July, the TTP had claimed responsibility for an attack on a bus that killed 9 Chinese nationals in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. Due to the threat to Chinese citizens, KU's security adviser Dr Muhammad Zubair on March 31 wrote a letter to the slain director of the Confucius institute requesting him to restrict movement of his faculty members. In response, the institute's director had replied it was ôimportant to realise that rather than shifting responsibility, standard operation procedures should be devised for secure movement of Chinese facultyö.

So far, more than 180 countries and regions in the world have introduced Chinese language learning into their societies, and over 70 countries have incorporated Chinese learning and teaching into their national education systems. More than 20 million people out of China are learning Chinese, and the cumulative number of Chinese learners and users abroad is close to 200," he said.

He said the celebration was also the 13th United Nations Chinese Language Day, which has been celebrated annually on April 20 since 2010.

He thanked President Bio for attaching great importance to China-Sierra Leone relations and for his great effort in promoting mutual understanding between the two peoples through increased cultural exchanges.

"Language is one of the most remarkable creations of human beings and Chinese Language is one of the oldest languages in the world which has a history of thousands years and it is an important symbol of Chinese civilization and an important carrier of the Chinese culture," he said.

The Chinese Ambassador said President Xi Jinping has pointed out that people are the best bridge for exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations,whereas closer people-to-people exchanges and mutual learning is a sure way to eliminate estrangement and promote mutual understanding among nations.

He said with a good command of Chinese language, people can understand the brilliant Chinese culture better characterized by a world view of harmony between humanity and nature, a global view of coordination and cooperation among all countries, a social view of unity but not uniformity, and a moral outlook of kindness and righteousness.

He continued that with Chinese language, people would find it easier not only to appreciate China's profound history, current development and promising future, but also to do business and conduct all other kinds of exchanges with the Chinese people.

He further said Confucius institute and other Chinese language education institutions have done a lot to provide support to people around the world in learning Chinese and understanding China.

"Today's event is not only a program for popularizing the Chinese language, but also an important occasion for appreciating the Chinese culture. I have taken note that our Confucius institute at FBC has prepared several Chinese cultural programs here, such as calligraphy, tea ceremony, and paper-cutting as well as some Chinese folk shows like Chinese Kung-fu and dance. I am sure that you can feel the joyous atmosphere brought about by the Chinese culture and I hope today's event would bring our two people even closer, and enhance our mutual understandings with each other," he said.

He said Chinese side would continue to deepen educational and cultural exchanges with Sierra Leonean and assured everyone that once the COVID-19 pandemic is brought under control, more and more Sierra Leonean friends would be invited to China to experience the charm of their culture.

Beijing, China: Government of the People's Republic of China has issued the following news release:

Chinese culture is becoming more entrenched in young Namibians as they are passionately pursuing the Chinese language.

Rena Stephanus, a communication graduate, based in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, enrolled in a Chinese language course at the Confucius institute at the University of Namibia this year, in hopes of diversifying her linguistic portfolio.

"Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. Wherever you are in the world, you will be exposed to the language one way or another. My curiosity about China and its people motivated me to enroll," she said on April 20 when the UN Chinese Language Day was observed in the world.

Stephanus believed that Chinese (language) adeptness is essential for her to communicate. "The elimination of communication barriers is the primary reason I enrolled for Mandarin."

Although a beginner in the course, Stephanus has seen her interest grow in China's history and the Chinese culture.

According to Stephanus, Chinese art, music, cuisine and literature have now become an integral part of her life.

"The culturally rich country (China) has so much to be explored and the exposure to the language gradually enhances my basic understanding of China and its people," Stephanus said.

Loide Mateus, a Confucius institute alumnus, studied the Chinese language for three years.

"At the time, there was a stereotype that the Chinese language is difficult. But the exposure to the Asian language and culture altered my outlook on life," she said, who declared that Chinese proficiency has sharpened her cognitive skills and made intercultural interactions meaningful. "I embrace knowing another language. I love the Chinese culture, celebrate festivals, and the Chinese food is delicious. I see myself as a conduit between China and Namibia."

The ability to speak the language has brought many opportunities for Mateus.

"I had been offered many opportunities by local companies to work on temporary contracts. Not only because of my language skills but also because (of the fact that) I understand cultural diversity and my open-mindedness to life thanks to learning the Chinese language," Mateus said. "Apart from sharing what I know in my immediate social environment, I also share a lot via social media, especially my travels to China and the Chinese culture on my Instagram account. Likewise, answering the questions from friends and community. I have also inspired younger siblings to enroll in the Chinese language."

Henan Normal University (HNU), China, and Millennium Education, Pakistan, have signed an online agreement to jointly build a Confucius Classroom, the 14th Confucius institute (Classroom) in Henan Province, to facilitate cultural exchange under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

The staff of the Millennium Education believed the new classroom will provide abundant resources and great convenience for Pakistani youth to access and understand Chinese culture, China Economic Net (CEN) reported on Thursday.

In comparison with that Confucius institutes are only set up in universities, Confucius Classrooms are open to primary and secondary schools and other cultural and educational institutions. It means that not only college students, but also Pakistani juveniles aged between 12 and 18 have access to authentic Chinese culture, which contributes greatly to the connectivity of people in the two countries.

After many rounds of communication, HNU and Millennium Education have reached a consensus on carrying out international Chinese language education. According to a teacher of HNU, the Confucius Classroom will give full play to the professional advantages of participating institutions, base on the local characteristics and the actual demand, and provide systematic Chinese education for Pakistani youth. The classroom will support Pakistan to improve education, train talents for CPEC construction, and promote people-to-people cultural exchanges between China and Pakistan,A she said.

Before signing the agreement with Millennium Education, HNU has already contributed to Pakistani education through the Confucius institute jointly initiated with Sargodha University.

Despite the pandemic of COVID-19, the Sargodha University Confucius institute was signed on April 13th 2020. On the next day, Sargodha University received a batch of medical supplies donated by HNU.

when he was quoted, in 2018, as describing its countries in a derogatory manner.

He has also remained mum on strengthening ties within the African continent in his four years in office.

A Trump win could be good for Africa, according to Dr David Monyae, the co-director of the University of Johannesburg's Confucius institute.

"A Trump win will be a continuity of what we all know. Trump himself remains outright racist, and Africa is not something that is close to his radar screen. As negative as it appears, it (will be) a blessing in disguise for Africa," he said.

Monyae said although Trump's ignorance about the continent could be welcomed, concerns remained about his approach to multilateral structures such as the World Health Organization (WHO).

Trump withdrew the US from the WHO, citing its lack of action against China over that country's handling of itsCovid-19 epidemic. This, Monyae said, would leave the WHO with a large shortfall in funding as the US was one of its leading donors.

"The continent relies heavily on global institutions such as the WHO and the UN. And Trump in the past four years has disrupted global institutions, and that will be bad news for the African continent.

"You will not have a globally unified front in the fight against Covid-19, global agreements to deal with issues of climate change; you are not going to have a smooth position of peacekeepers," said Monyae.

Another negative aspect was that Trump was less likely to see Africa and its emerging markets as fertile ground for investment .

"He tends to see Africa in relation to his other conflicts, with Russia and China," Monyae said.

Similar sentiments were expressed by Wits Professor John Stremlau, who said a Biden/Harris (former US vice-president Joe Biden and vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris) win might result in a different approach towards the continent.

"The real difference will be the tone - the tone for Trump is a total disregard for Africa. The denigration of Africa. While Biden and Harris would be much more forthcoming in terms of finding stable partnerships that would be mutually beneficial, such as on issues about climate change," he said.

Professor Garth le Pere from the University of Pretoria said Trump's foreign policy has been "very transactional", especially with regard to relations with regions like the Middle East.

Another four years of Trump would likely see a continued assault on organisations that did not serve Trump's objective of "America first".

"He is likely to go after the UN as he feels that the UN adds absolutely no value to American interests," Le Pere said.

The Mariano Marcos State University (MMSU) here and the Chinese Consulate of Laoag are planning to put up a Confucius institute (CI) to make the Mandarin language readily available to all Ilocanos and make them more competent in finding jobs elsewhere in the world.

MMSU President Shirley C. Agrupis, in an interview on Friday, said the CI is one way to strengthen the partnership between MMSU and the various colleges and universities in China, and that this program is well-supported by Zhou Youbin, head of the Chinese consulate in the province.

'This program is to promote the Chinese language and culture in Ilocos Norte, as we plan to support and strengthen the teaching of Mandarin language, aside from facilitating cultural exchanges between the MMSU and some reputable Chinese universities,' Agrupis said, adding that MMSU has 150 Ilocano students enrolled in Mandarin class in its Languages and Literature Department of the College of Arts and Sciences.

She said aside from the establishment of the CI, the university is collaborating with China's Shandong province, with the help of the provincial government of Ilocos Norte, to pursue a collaborative effort to strengthen agricultural research, especially in areas of smart agriculture, through student and faculty mobility.

Smart agriculture is one of the government's efforts to modernize and strengthen the agriculture sector, which involves the promotion and adoption of advanced technology to increase farm productivity.

'In line with this, we are also eyeing to send faculty scholars (to) various partner-universities in China so that they will be educated and learn the modern technology that China is promoting," Agrupis said.

Confucius institutes are clearly sponsored by Beijing: Confucius institutes (CIs) are organizations primarily located on U.S. college and university campuses that push out skewed Chinese language and cultural training for U.S. students as part of Beijings multifaceted propaganda efforts. The PRC government partially funds these programs, under guidance from the CCPs United Front Work Department. On August 13, 2020, the Department of State designated the Confucius institute U.S. Center (CIUS), which serves as the Washington D.C.-based de facto headquarters of the Confucius institute network, as a foreign mission of the Peoples Republic of China. The opacity of this organization and its state-directed nature are the driving reasons behind this designation.

This action will not close the CIUS, nor will it require U.S. colleges or universities to close individual Confucius institutes. Instead, designating the CIUS as a foreign mission will ensure much needed transparency by requiring the CIUS to regularly provide information to the State Department about PRC citizen personnel, recruiting, funding, and operations in the United States. With greater transparency, educational institutions can make more informed choices about the influence being exerted on their campuses and whether and how these Beijing-backed programs should continue to teach their students.

The Office of Chinese Language Council International (Hanban), an organization affiliated with the PRC Ministry of Education, has historically served as the Beijing-based parent organization of the Confucius institute U.S. Center and, through it, supports many of the individual CIs. Filings with the Internal Revenue Service indicate that CIUS is directly funded by Hanban.

There are currently 75 Confucius institutes operating in the United States, 65 of which are active on U.S. university campuses, with the rest functioning as standalone organizations.

There are around 500 Confucius Classrooms based on K-12 campuses. Most are affiliated with one of the university-based Confucius institutes.

Beijings influence on U.S. campuses: The influence of the Chinese government and impact of Chinese Communist Party ideology on Confucius institute programming has long been a cause for concern on U.S. campuses, as has the governing arrangements of individual Confucius institutes which often lack transparency. Confucius institutes are an important part of Chinas overseas propaganda setup, said Politburo Standing Committee ideology czar Li Changchun in 2009.

A 2017 report on CIs by the National Association of Scholars found that some CI faculty face pressure to self-censor, contracts between the CIs and host universities are often not publicly available, that some universities are presented with financial incentives to not criticize China, and CI materials often present a selective knowledge of Chinese history by avoiding topics related to human rights abuses.

A 2019 study by researchers from the University College Dublin, summarized in an Op Ed in the Washington Post, found that after a Confucius institute opens, there is a statistically significant shift in the tone of local media stories in the PRCs favor in the area where the CI is located. In 2014, the American Association of University Professors warned that Confucius institutes further the political goals of Beijings leadership and threaten the independence and integrity of academic institutions.

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) found that Confucius institutes operate with heavy oversight from the United Front Work Department, the Chinese Communist Partys overseas propaganda and influence operation, noting that the former head of the United Front currently chairs the Confucius institutes Beijing headquarters.

According to media reports, in 2018 a keynote speaker at Savannah State University had a reference to Taiwan deleted from her bio at the request of the co-director of the universitys CI.

Colleges are rethinking Confucius institutes: Universities across the country and around the world have already begun to take a closer look at the programming of Confucius institutes as part of a larger review of the scope of Beijings influence over higher education institutions globally.

Over the past two years, dozens of colleges and universities in the United States have decided to break ties and close their Confucius institutes.

Universities in Sweden, Germany, India, and elsewhere have either closed their Confucius institutes or are taking steps to mandate greater transparency from them.

Shared concerns about the actions of the PRC government are part of the reason why the State Department and others in the U.S. government have stepped up engagement with universities on risks to research, threats to academic freedom, disclosure of foreign funding, and other matters. We encourage all relevant higher-education stakeholders administrators, boards of directors, state governments, etc. to review their relationships with China and especially with the PRC government to ensure they are protecting their institutions.

US Department of State designated Thursday Confucius institute US Center (CIUS) as a "foreign mission" of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced. "Today, the Department of State designated the Confucius institute U.S. Center as a foreign mission of the PRC, recognizing CIUS for what it is: an entity advancing Beijing's global propaganda and malign influence campaign on US campuses and K-12 classrooms," Pompeo said in a statement. He added that Confucius institutes "are funded by the PRC and part of the Chinese Communist Party's global influence and propaganda apparatus." He stressed that "the goal of these actions is simple: to ensure that American educators and school administrators can make informed choices about whether these CCP-backed programs should be allowed to continue, and if so, in what fashion." He noted that "universities around the country and around the world are examining the Confucius institutes' curriculum and the scope of Beijing's influence in their education systems." "The United States wants to ensure that students on US campuses have access to Chinese language and cultural offerings free from the manipulation of the Chinese Communist Party and its proxies," he remarked. The US top diplomat said that the PRC "has taken advantage of America's openness to undertake large scale and well-funded propaganda efforts and influence operations in this country." (end) si.mt

Following reports that the education ministry was reviewing the presence of China's Confucius institutes in the country, China on Tuesday urged India to treat cooperation in higher education in a fair and objective manner and also to not politicise "normal cooperation". The Chinese embassy here also called upon India to maintain "healthy and stable" development of China-India people-to-people and cultural exchanges.China's statement, according to the spokesperson, was in response to reports that India has decided to review Confucius institutes and Confucius Classrooms jointly established by China's Confucius institute and seven Indian universities and colleges, and also 54 MoUs for inter-school cooperation signed between Indian and Chinese higher education institutions."Over the years, Confucius institutes have played an important role in promoting Chinese language teaching in India and China-India people-to-people and cultural exchanges. This has been generally recognised by the Indian education community," spokesperson Ji Rong said, adding that with increasingly close economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and India, the demand for Chinese language teaching in India was growing.India has never really been enthusiastic about Confucius institutes in the past too despite Beijing calling upon India to, as Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during his visit to India in 2018, develop these institutes. The UGC last year had officially asked Indian universities to seek approval from the central government, including the home and foreign ministries, before entering into any agreement for setting up a Confucius institute.These institutes have been accused by many western countries of spreading Chinese propaganda. Sweden, for one, was reported to have shut all Confucius institutes operating in the country earlier this year.The official said China-India cooperation on Confucius institute project had been carried out for more than 10 years.

 Ghana's tourism sector will take between two to three years to fully recover from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic,an Associate Professor at the Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management of the University of Cape Coast (UCC), Prof. Ishmael Mensah has predicted.

Speaking to the Ghanaian Times in an interview yesterday, Prof. Mensahwho is also the Ghana Director of the Confucius institute, UCC said that the International Tourism Organisation (ITO) projected a decline of international tourist arrival between 20 and 30 percent for the year due to the impact of COVID-19.

This he explained would impact Ghana's tourism sector extensively due to the fact that the domestic tourism industry had not been developed.

He has, therefore, asked players within the sector to brace themselves up for the setback and innovate to ensure they survived the scourge even as steps were taken to ease the restrictions.

In addition, he has urgedthe government to lead the way in the recovery processes since it was one of the critical sectors of the Ghanaian Economy, stressing that"We should not leave the recovery efforts in the hands of hotels, airlines and other organisations within the value chain" he said.

Tourism until the discovery of oil in commercial quantities was the third highest foreign exchange earner for the country, however, with the discovery, it has been dislodged.

Currently, it is the fourth largest foreign exchange earner with more than $1.7billion, representing about six per cent of the country's Gross Domestic Product for 2019.

Prof. Mensah said the sector had globally declined due to the pandemic; however, the impact of the decline at the local level would differ depending on individual countries.

"The tourism sector globally has declined due to the pandemic; however, the impact at the local level can be even more devastating unless some innovative ways are adopted to prop up the sector.

"I see, a number of hotels have shut down whiles other agencies within the industry are facing challenges of eminent collapse," he said.

The average occupancy rate before COVID-19, he said, was 70 percent but the emergence of the virus had slashed the average occupancy ratio to 30 percent with others registering as low as five percent and below, saying, "Our hotels are in serious distress".

However, he said the domestic market even though not well developed, would commence with the recovery processes first and then that of inbound tourism would pick up gradually, adding that, "the road to recovery will be a long while."

Prof. indicated that the tourism sector was a resilient one, saying, "We have to understand that all is not lost but the state needsto put in adequate measures to ensure the sector gets out of the current challenges quickly".

As part of the recovery processes, he called for the state to put up an intensified promotional and marketing campaign, adding that "such a campaign may enable the country discover new markets."

He commended government for showing leadership with the GH¢600 million stimuluspackages for businesses and urged those in the industry to apply for funds to address their challenges.

However, he said there would be the need for the "Beyond the Return" project which was supposed to have commenced this year to be re-launched when things normalised in about two to three years time to enable the sector to take full advantage of the diasporan market.

On a possible slump of tourism from being the fourth foreign exchange earner in the country, Prof. Mensah said, that would not materialise with a decline in the other entire sectors due to the pandemic.

"Tourism will continue to be the fourth exchange ex-change earner despite the challenges the sector is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic" he said.

In the beginning of winter 2015, I had an opportunity to experience the Trans-Himalayan flight from Kathmandu to Beijing via Lhasa in a group of Nepali students. I had got scholarship from Confucius institute, Kathmandu to study at the Hebei University of Business and Economics.

After we reached Beijing at night, the travel from airport to the university was full of excitements as well as lots of questions arising in our mind.

The next morning we were welcomed by the university staff and the hospitality was beyond our expectation, we all were touched.

After our arrival in the university, it took us few days to be familiar with the Chinese food and customs. Especially learning to use chopsticks took us a bit time and we used to laugh at each other as most of the students were beginners to use it. In addition, as we got used to with our university routine and everything around, everyday we would meet many Chinese colleagues who asked me where I came from and humbly request to get connected with them on WeChat and to take a picture together. I had never been so popular in Nepal. Since then, China has been my second home and a constant source for my knowledge and skill developments with special reference to modern technology. In mid-January 2020, a news of COVID-19 spread like a wild fire on the one hand and I myself as an alumni in one of the Chinese Universities really shocked me while I used to remember my Chinese friends, their families and the entire Chinese people on the other. Undoubtedly, it was a humanitarian crisis but the interpretations were made according to their convenience from country to country for unknown reasons. During the earthquake in Nepal 2015, prior to my China visit I had a wonderful opportunity to work as an interpreter with the Chinese medical team (Blue Sky Rescue) at Sankhu Kathmandu, one of the most devastated areas from the disaster. Unfortunately, I was not in a position to assist the ailing people of COVID-19 except focusing my mind on news headlines and praying for the victims. Nepal-China relations are based on mutual harmony as good neighbours. In every twists and turns, ups and downs China has not only been proven as a good neighbour but also a benevolent partner in many dimensions.

The continuity of history in bilateral relations is dated back to the marriage between Songtsen Gampo and Bhrikuti. Furthermore, there is a significant contribution of China in the overall national development of Nepal. Today, China is the largest exporter in the global market whereas Nepal is lucky to have such a country as its immediate neighbour. How Nepal can be benefited from China will largely depend on the Nepal's diplomatic manoeuvre with its sincerity and good intentions.

It is in the best national interest of Nepal to be abided by the ethical norms and values in its policy not to hurt a neighbour.

There is a freedom for media, right to inform to national and global community in a number of issues. COVID-19 as a humanitarian issue demands an ethical reporting by writings, pictures, and postures in spite of the individual loyalty of a media house. Sensationalization of issue is not an ethical journalism which is detrimental to the bilateral relations and hurting the neighbours at the cost of diplomacy.

At this juncture, we need to demonstrate as an ally with true sentiments with the people of China and the entire world and also we need to understand the Chinese expectations from Nepal as a good neighbour.

The fundamental fact is that what China expects from us is just a good-will and pray for the quick relief from this traumatic situation. Finally, how a nation copes with dangers and dilemmas posed by natural and man-made disasters is determined by the quality of its leadership.

The Chinese President Xi Jin Ping in battling COVID-19 says, "The Chinese nation has experienced many ordeals in its history but it has never been overwhelmed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing up and rising up from the hardships. "This humanitarian crisis has to be settled through the unified diagnostic effort and pioneering to get rid of this crisis globally. Everyone has to honestly stipulate the fact that Xi Jin Ping has expressed and Nepal also has to express its solidarity with the Chinese and the entire world as a global family.

Owing to the existing fact, we are a part of capitalism and globalization.

One could be pushed into many needs that might ultimately change the loyalty overnight. But we should not forget the reality that we cannot change our neighbour. My humble pray goes for all the victims around the world from the bottom of my heart. May Lord Buddha bless all of us in our endeavour.

UWC is showing its support for China as it puts up a brave fight against the coronavirus.

UWC rector and vice-chancellor Tyrone Pretorius wrote a letter to partner universities in China, at the start of the outbreak to express UWC's support.

Last week, the 78-member UWC student choir followed his lead by showcasing their support in song. They sang the Chinese national anthem to a group of Chinese lecturers as a gesture of encouragement and support.

Iris Wu, who co-heads the Confucius institute - a centre at UWC which focuses on academic and cultural exchange, and student development - said: "As a university, we want to show the Chinese people here and abroad that we practise our motto: that UWC truly is a place of hope and action through knowledge."

Sporting their UWC 60th anniversary T-shirts, choir members held posters with messages of encouragement, including - "Isolate the virus and not the people"; "We support China"; "Our hands reach out"; and "We are all in this together, don't lose hope".

Choir supervisor Sibusiso Njeza said: "This is our responsibility as global citizens. It might be China today, but it can be us tomorrow. China has really become so entrenched in our world; think about our cellphones and computers. We should think about how we can support and help each other."

A student and member of the choir, Rozanne Cloete told the audience: "As we were learning the Chinese national anthem, we found it to be very powerful.

"There is one particularly meaningful line: 'Many hearts, but one mind'. I think it is a very relevant message for this situation - to support each other in this difficult time and to be of one mind."

Wu said that as a Chinese citizen, it was an emotional moment for her when the choir raised their fists as they sang the South African national anthem, and later, We Are the World.

"I could feel the spirit of oneness that we are fighting the same fight and trying to do what we can to curb the spread of the virus."

Last week, the World Health Organisation indicated that the virus had infected 75 200 people around the world, and killed 2 009 individuals, mostly in China. Supplied

A SCHOOL that was damaged during the April floods last year will start 2020 on a better footing after a generous donation.

Clairwood Secondary School was given R500Â 000 to rebuild and it received a Mandarin Teaching Station from the Confucius institute late last year.

Yugan Naidoo, the principal at Clairwood Secondary School, said he was grateful for the generosity of the Chinese Embassy in South Africa.

"Our school's relationship with the Chinese government began earlier this year when I went to a Chinese New Year celebration at the Durban University for Technology," said Naidoo. "I was one of the few principals to attend. They were grateful and wanted to visit our school to see how they could help us."

Naidoo said the visit came at a time when the school was struggling financially and recouping from the April floods.

The water, said Naidoo, was thigh high and many classrooms were damaged.

"I took the delegation on a tour of the school and showed them what we were working with. We are a co-ed trade school with over 1Â 000 learners and we use specialised classrooms.

"Some of the classes we offer include electrical, motor and diesel engineering, welding and construction. The classrooms had severe water damage and the equipment was destroyed."

Stemming from the on-site meeting, he said Hisense, a subsidiary company of the Chinese multinational, had shown an interest in advancing careers in refrigeration and air-conditioning, and offered learnership opportunities.

Beijing Automobile Industry Holding Company, owned by the Beijing Municipal Government, also offered learnership programmes and employment to learners at their factory in Port Elizabeth.

"These contributions come as a silver lining after the tough year we have had. And in light of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it brings hope to the lives of our learners."

Naidoo said a former pupil, Professor Anil Sooklal, now the deputy director-general for Asia and Middle East at the Department of International Relations and Co-operation, was instrumental in networking between the school and the Chinese government.

The Chinese government also donated the Mandarin Teaching Station comprising 20 computers and printers. The government ensured that the pupils would receive free Mandarin lessons from next year.

Sooklal said: "This is not a donation. It's an investment in South Africa and an investment in our people, in our youth, and that's the greatest gift China has given us."

He said the Chinese government wanted to uplift the global community, and Africa in particular.

"And we are fortunate that China is our largest partner globally today. They have a desire to share their experience."

Lin Songtian, the Chinese ambassador to South Africa, said educating children was critical for the future.

"Education is an investment in the future, so if we are to develop this country, we need to develop the people first."

He said bilateral relations between China and Africa, particularly with South Africa, were important to help fight poverty and ensure common prosperity.

"If you had the capacity to develop countries and families by yourself, you would do so. Anyone who can help Africa to develop the economy and its people is a true friend."

"Education is not only very important for the family, for the people and also for the nation, but to invest in education is to invest in the future, so this is why we are here. If we are to develop this country, we need to develop our people first," Songtian said.

He said he had mobilised Chinese universities to become partners with local universities so that they could help to update facilities at local universities. "If the facilities lag, it's hard for you to produce the future products, and so it is very important to have new equipment," he said.

He also said bilateral relations between China and the African continent, and South Africa in particular, were important to help both the continent and the country fight poverty and ensure common prosperity.

"If you have the capacity, you would be able to develop the country and develop families by yourself, so whoever can help this continent and help this country to develop the economy and human resources is a true friend," he said.

Professor Anil Sooklal, deputy director-general for Asia and Middle East at the Department of International Relations and Co-operation, said a successful China meant a successful South Africa, because the Chinese wanted to see South Africa grow and prosper. "This is not a donation, it's an investment in South Africa, and an investment in the people of South Africa, in our youth, and that's the greatest gift China can give South Africa. That's the spirit of China that I've come to know," Sooklal said.

He added: "It is China's sincere desire to uplift the global community, Africa in particular, and we are fortunate that China is our largest partner globally today. It's a deep desire to share their experience in making sure we move out of poverty and underdevelopment, and also share the experience that you see in China today."

China has pledged to assist Zimbabwe with developmental aid and foreign direct funding increasing from US$2,1 billion it extended to the country last year.

Speaking during a Confucius institute "Know China" conference at the University of Zimbabwe yesterday China's Deputy Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Zhao Baogang said apart from the grant and FDI that Zimbabwe benefited in 2018 alone, China remains very much committed to avail more funding.

"Bilateral co-operation is very important. China is the only country that has done most for Zimbabwe through provision of grants and loans. We are doing a lot, trying to help and in future we will do more than those countries that impose sanctions here.

"Last year alone China availed US$2,1 billion grant for various projects including the Hwange Thermal Power Station US$ 1 billion, Kariba South extension over US$ 500 million, Harare (Robert Gabriel Mugabe) International Airport US$150 million and Victoria Falls International Airport US$150 million," he said.

Mr Baogang said China feels the US$487 million FDI injected into Zimbabwe was still way below the country's potential.

"We feel the US$487 million is not enough and we hope that the Government would fast track or resolve some of the impediments in the investment policies so that more FDI continues to pour," he said.

Renmin University of China vice president Professor Wu Xiaqin, who was the guest of honour, said the anti-corruption crusade being spearheaded by Government was one of the key pillars to achieving prosperity.

"Fostering talent is also vital for our economic growth, but the fight against the vice of corruption is key for our development. Corruption affects many things including rising operation costs and as China we fought hard against it.

"Chinese top Government officials including ministers, mayors were arrested and this made China rich and a modern powerhouse," he said.

Professor Wu Xiaqin said patriotism was also vital for development and in China's quest for prosperity the Communist political party was supreme over Government in terms of policy direction.

University of Zimbabwe Vice Chancellor Professor Paul Mapfumo in a speech read on his behalf by his deputy, Academic Affairs, Professor Rosemary Moyana said instead of depending on Chinese investors it was high time African nations explore opportunities for serious business engagement with China.

"This kind of interaction should make the ground fertile for prospects of empowerment through a better understanding of China's social, cultural, political and economic environment," he said.

HEADQUARTERED at UWC, the Confucius institute for Chinese Medicine (CICM) integrates traditional and modern Chinese medicine science with Chinese language teaching, to open a new window for South Africans to understand Chinese culture and build a new bridge for cooperation between China and Africa in the field of traditional medicine.

Launched this week as the first of its kind on the African continent, it was jointly established by UWC in Cape Town, Chinese Zhejing Normal University and Zhejing Chinese Medical University.

The Consul General of China, Lin Jing, said the institute integrated traditional and modern Chinese medicine science with Chinese language teaching. Lin said with the deepening friendship between China and South Africa, "time has ripened for the establishment of the Confucius institute for Chinese Medicine at UWC, which is luckily in our consular district".

It is another important achievement of the cultural exchanges and practical co-operation between the two countries, and also the implementation of capacity building and people-to-people exchange in the "Eight Major Initiatives" proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) last year, Lin said.

UWC's Rector Professor Tyrone Pretorius visited China late last year to sign the agreement that finalised the establishment of the CICM.

In the coming years, UWC will use this platform to work with Chinese universities in a range of areas and activities, including culture, language, Chinese medicine and academic research.

The CICM will help facilitate academic co-operation among the universities in South Africa and China.

One of the UWC's goals as a research institution is creating networks of co-operation across the globe because the UWC believes collaboration and international mobility make science stronger, said UWC executive director for human resources Meko Magida.

"By removing geographical boundaries and learning from each other, we can tackle the biggest issues facing society today," she said.

In addition to the CICM, South Africa is home to six Confucius institutes and three Confucius Classrooms, the largest number in Africa.

A Chinese language programme will officially launch in UAE schools starting this September, a report by the UAE Ministry of Education has revealed.

Titled, 'Chinese Language Programme: Current Status and Future Plan,' the ministry report that was reviewed by the Emirates News Agency, WAM, noted the "historic peak" in relations between the UAE and China, adding that there is a growing interest among "Emirati people to understand the Chinese language and culture."

Hussain Al Hammadi, the UAE Minister of Education, and the Confucius institute's Deputy Chief Executive, Ma Jianfei, signed an MoU on Monday to introduce the Chinese language in UAE education curricula, during the state visit of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, to China.

According to the ministry report, two reports - the 'National Chinese Language Curriculum Framework,' which focuses on the student learning outcomes, and the 'National Chinese Curriculum Syllabus,' which focuses on the details and scope of the content - were prepared to support the implementation of the Chinese language curriculum for the 2019-2020 academic year.

The ministry explained that the 'National Chinese Language Curriculum Framework' adopts a level-based approach to Chinese language learning.

It describes learning outcomes for students in grades 7-12 across a six-level scale, with four skills addressed separately within each level. Each level of the ministry's Chinese Language Levels is aligned to the Chinese Language Proficiency Test, known as Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, and the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, CEFR.

The Ministry of Education is planning to recruit 150 Chinese language teachers for the academic year 2019-2020, the report said.

Teaching resources are also being developed by the ministry. According to the report, 18-part books 'Across the Silk Route' for the 2019-2020 academic year, cover the six levels - each level has three books.

The books series adopt a "holistic approach" to learning, and emphasise the development of listening, speaking, reading and writing skills, the report explained.

The primary goal of the series is to help students in UAE schools to "establish a solid foundation of vocabulary" and "knowledge of Chinese and communicative skills through the natural and gradual integration of language, content and cultural elements," the report added.

Other books are also being developed in cooperation with China's Nishan Press, to help UAE students better understand Chinese culture and society via nine aspects - art and design, mathematics, geography, science, music and drama, history, literature, sports and society.

Following its launch in September 2019, the programme's implementation stage will be carried out over the next three years, the report said, noting ongoing monitoring and evaluation processes will take place to ensure its effectiveness.

Plans to establish a "Chinese Centre" at the Ministry are in progress, the report said, adding that there is a need for such a centre to be established so that Chinese specialists carry out the monitoring and evaluation processes.

"Continuous support from both the UAE and China is of vital importance to the sustainable development of Chinese learning and teaching at schools," the report highlighted.

In 2017, the Ministry of Education's Under-Secretaries, Dr. Harmad Al Yahyaei and Matar Alhameli, visited the Confucius institute Headquarters, Hanban, in Beijing to discuss how the Chinese language curriculum would be implemented in UAE schools.

A report was submitted to the Ministry of Education by the Confucius institute's Professor Zhiping Zhu and Dr Xiaoming Lan in July 2017, marking progress on the Chinese language programme's implementation. Two months later, following a rigourous selection and training process, the first 20 Chinese language teachers were recruited and deployed to 11 public schools to teach Chinese to grade 10 students.

A two-month Chinese language proficiency training course for custom officers at the Kotoka International Airport (KIA) has ended in Accra on Thursday.

The programme supervised by the Confucius institute of the University of Ghana, saw over 120 custom officers graduating with proficiency in the Chinese language.

The course was aimed at ensuring that customs officers at the KIA were able to communicate effectively with Chinese visitors since Ghana has become a regular destination for the Chinese.

Speaking at the closing ceremony of the programme, Assistant Commissioner, Habib Osman said the initiative was very laudable as it would help the custom officers perform their duties efficiently.

"Customs constantly come across people of diverse backgrounds who patronise our dear country for various reasons and we need to understand and interact well with our clients to ensure effective communication and coexistence," he stated.

He added that, "China is the global economic force whose trade with Ghana and that of the world has tremendously improved over the years".

For that reason he said, Customs need to enhance their work at the airport by providing and sponsoring a well-structured Chinese language proficiency course for easy interaction with the Chinese.

He called for a continuous collaboration with the Chinese to develop various sectors of Ghana's economy including trade, tourism and culture.

Chief Revenue Officer at KIA, Mr John Acquah congratulated the officers for successfully completing the course and expressing themselves well in the Chinese language.

"We are hoping that more of such courses would be organised in different foreign languages to benefit our officers in Tema and other parts of the country," he stated.

"Our Chinese community is growing and we are doing more business with them. And more people including professionals, business people and visitors so we need to equip our officers to be able to communicate with them very well and educate them on the opportunities available," he added.

In a long term he said, the move would help facilitate trade and as officers would be able to explain tax policies to the Chinese, who are major investors, in order to be tax compliant.

"We could be able to educate them on their tax responsibilities and ensure they comply adequately," he stressed.

Participants were presented with certificates and urged to use the proficiency in the Chinese language to improve upon communication and other activities with the Chinese.

A 10-ten-member high-powered government delegation led by Professor Kwesi Yankah, Minister of State in charge of Tertiary Education, is in the People's Republic of China to discuss issues on development and quality education.

The delegation, made up of representatives of educational and stakeholder institutions in Ghana are currently holding official meetings with the leadership of the Confucius institute of China.

They also visited the headquarters of the Confucius institute in Beijing, where they had a meeting with the Deputy Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Institute, Mr Yu Yunfeng.

Mr Robert Abeiku Ansah, special aide to Prof Kwesi Yankah told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) through a telephone interview that, the visit was to offer both parties an opportunity to renew their commitments towards existing agreements and also explore possible avenues for academic partnership, future collaborations and scholarly exchanges.

The Confucius institute promotes and teaches Chinese culture and language around the world, and also helps to develop Chinese language courses, train teachers, host cultural and artistic presentations and provide information about modern day China's development.

It has a branch at the University of Cape Coast (UCC), through a partnership arrangement between the Hunan City University and UCC, which had trained as many as 40 Ghanaian students in Chinese culture and language, and are currently teaching the language across Ghana.

The institute currently has a student population of nearly 10,000 in local curricula structures across Ghana, with the establishment of an independent library and language laboratory.

It is in line with this that the two universities are sharing resources to open up educational opportunities in China for Ghanaian students who may want to study in China or pursue business ventures in the Asian state.

The special aide said the delegation would also engage government officials and university authorities in China on major issues of great importance, including capacity building exchange, signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and others to strengthen diplomatic ties.

He said Mr Yu Yunfeng expressed his appreciation to the Government of Ghana for the support given to the Confucius institute to establish learning centres at the UCC, University of Ghana and other learning centres across senior high schools in Ghana.

He said the establishment of the Confucius institute forms part of efforts to deepen the diplomatic relationship between Ghana and China, and was optimistic that it will serve as a link to bridge the language gap between the two countries to promote trade, technology transfer, and cultural exchanges among others.

"In Ghana, University Practice Senior High School (SHS) and Mfantsipim School are few of the schools that have Confucius classrooms," Mr Yu Yunfeng said, adding that, they served as additional material for teachers.

Mr Ansah said Professor Kwesi Yankah extended the appreciation of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to China for the collaboration between the two countries, and enormous support received in Ghana's industrialisation agenda from China.

"It is getting clearer and clearer that as the volume of trade between Ghana and China increases from year to year, the need arises for us to expand further our immersion in each other's language and culture," Prof Yankah said.

He stated that this would be meaningful for strengthening equity in the exchanges, if Ghanaian universities, language centres and institutes had similar schemes to teach Ghanaian languages and promote culture and business in Ghana.

Prof Yankah noted that even though Chinese sounds like a difficult language to Africans, linguistics were convinced that proficiency in the language subsequently became easier with time, and that Chinese grammar and syntax were no more difficult to learn.

The Ghanaian delegation to China include the Executive Secretary of the National Accreditation Board, Dr Kingsley Nyarko, Prof. Frank John Eshun, Vice Chancellor of Takoradi Technical University and the Director of Confucius institute, UCC, Prof Hu Liangcai.

At the 8th World Peace Forum luncheon hosted by Tsinghua University, Le Yucheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, answered the on-site question and pointed out that there have been some very abnormal phenomena in the recent cultural exchanges between China and the United States. Chinese experts and scholars have been frequently blocked in the United States. Chinese scientists in the United States are also subject to discrimination, harassment, abuse, and some are dismissed without cause. Many Chinese students studying in the United States have been monitored or refused for various reasons.

The Confucius institute was also ordered to close. This practice of using bloodlines and ethnicity as a label to block humanities communication between the two countries is unpopular. The friendly exchanges between China and the United States are the foundation of Sino-US relations. If normal personnel exchanges are artificially cut, how can the relationship between the two major powers be maintained and developed?

A visiting research fellow of the Confucius institute in Qufu for almost five years, Professor Mendis involves in promoting Chinese culture and Confucian values in addition to better understanding between China and the United States. A former Rajawali senior fellow of the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and a research associate of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University, he is presently serving as an American commissioner to UNESCO, an UN agency in Paris.

Professor Yang Chaoming, the president of the Confucius institute, welcomed Professor Mendis and other distinguished researchers at the Qufu symposium. The invited experts included the deputy party secretary and vice president of the Institute Dr. Mi Huaiyong and other nationally-prominent Confucius scholars like Dr. Wang Junlin and Dr. Liu Guangsheng.

Introducing the honoured guest, President Yang said that the Harvard-trained scholar is 'an American educator, diplomat, author, and government official.' Professor Yang then added, 'Dr. Mendis is a friend of China.' He has been committed to 'promoting and disseminating China's excellent traditional culture, especially Confucianism in the world,' said the Institute president.

Moreover, Professor Mendis has been a prolific writer, actively discussing the positive impact of Chinese traditional culture, international trade, and the exchange of ideas. He has donated his important works, including the books on 'Trade for Peace,' 'Commercial Providence,' 'Peaceful War,' and many other works involving Sino-American relations and Confucian ethics to the collection centre of the Confucius institute.

Prior to receiving the certificate of honour, the Yenching Academy professor made a penetrating presentation titled 'Confucius in America: Inspiring the Founding Generation.' He then conducted in-depth discussions with the invited scholars on the influence of Confucian thoughts in the founding of the United States and the underlying cultural comparisons between China and America.

With numerous examples, he highlighted that Confucianism had an enduring impact on the thoughts of the Founding Fathers, especially Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, and Charles Thomson. Even George Washington and Thomas Jefferson benefited from China trade and Confucian culture, said Professor Mendis.

Bush administration.

'I have seen the New Jerusalem, and it is in China," Dr David Monyae, the co-director of the Confucius institute in Johannesburg told a packed SA-China dialogue at the University of the Witwatersrand yesterday.

Monyae, pictured, had just returned from the opening of the Import Expo in Shanghai, where 172 countries and organisations participated, with 400 000 Chinese purchasers in attendance.

"It seems China has conquered the future. It has uplifted 700 million people out of poverty. I went into a factory without a single worker on the factory floor - only machines. How are we going to compete with that? We are sleeping," Monyae said.

He emphasised that as Africans we need to add value to our products by beneficiating our resources, and we can no longer be simply exporting our raw materials. "To achieve our economic development we need to partner with strategic countries which include China, the UK and Germany."

Vice-Chancellor of Wits University Adam Habib articulated similar sentiments in his opening remarks saying, "We need to broaden our partnerships with urgency, and that includes looking east."

As the keynote speaker, Chinese Ambassador Lin Songtian depicted the China-South Africa relationship in particularly strategic terms. "We view each other as a strategic pivot," he said. "South Africa is the only country in the world that President Xi Jinping has paid three state visits to."

Lin hailed the huge advantages that South Africa has such as rich resources, superb location, and excellent conditions for development.

David Malcolmson, the chief director for Regional Organisations at Dirco, weighed in during the dialogue saying, "China responded immediately to South Africa's identification of the three main bottlenecks to its development, those being infrastructure, skills development, and financing."

Dr Andre Thomashausen, professor emeritus of International Law at Unisa, posed the question, "Where is Europe? China has invested over $100 billion in Africa since 2010, but we are not really sure what it is the European countries are doing."

But the executive director of the Institute of Global Dialogue, Dr Philani Mthembu, insisted that it is because of African agency that China has noticed the opportunities that the continent presents.

In an effort to contrast Chinese initiatives on the continent with that of some European powers, one of the participants said, "There is a European country that currently controls the foreign reserves of some Francophone African countries from their capital city. When those African countries do not behave in the manner in which that country wants, their foreign reserves are withheld.

"They also have military forces deployed on the continent that have led to the disintegration of countries like Libya."

Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has issued the following press release:

The Confucius institute at Kenyatta University hosted a Mid-Autumn poem conference on Friday that left the audience longing for more.

It was a mesmerizing moment as 20 Kenyan students at the institute fluently recited poems in Mandarin, drawing applause from the audience. The event featured other performances, including songs, martial arts and lion dances.

After the poetry recitation competition, 12 students received Ksh1,000 ($10) each as a gift for participating, while the five most commendable students received Ksh2,000 ($20) each. The overall winner received Ksh6,000 ($60), while the second and third place contestants received Ksh5,000 ($50) and Ksh3,000 ($30) respectively.

Speaking during the event, Dr Kamau Wango, director of the institute, said it was inspiring to see Kenyan students recite poems in Mandarin.

"This is very commendable and I hope the effort will continue. We are giving gifts in order to motivate students to pursue their talents. I encourage students to continue linking Mandarin with their career trajectories," he said.

Dr Wango said events like the poem conference give students a good platform to not only recite poems but also receive encouragement to become proficient in speaking Mandarin.

"Don't just do your exams; aim to score high and you will have an opportunity to go to China, where you can get an opportunity to have your eyes and minds opened up as well as a chance to pursue other endeavors," he said.

Dr Wango also encouraged the students to work hard and perform well in their HSK exams, the Chinese proficiency test, so that they can get an opportunity to attend summer camps. He said the 2018 camp was successful and that students should now start preparing for the 2019 one.

Professor Leonard Kisovi, board chairman for the institute, said it's important for Kenyan youth to learn Chinese language and culture because the Asian country is becoming a superpower. He added that Africa is moving away from colonial masters and facing the East for partnerships in development.

"It is important for the youth to learn Mandarin for the purpose of interacting. There are many opportunities in China, hence learning Mandarin is very important. It's also good to learn Chinese culture for the purpose of exposure," he said.

Charles Mwanika, who has been studying the language for one year, says Chinese culture is rich and exposes one to many things. He said the fact that the Mid-Autumn festival reunites families is very exciting.

Regina Achieng, another student, said the act of people traveling to their hometown to reunite with their relatives is very encouraging and she would love to see the same in Kenya.

The Mid-Autumn Festival is the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. It is a traditional cultural festival popular in China and neighboring countries influenced by Chinese culture, such as Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.

According to Zhuo Hao, a teacher at the institute, Mid-Autumn is a festival for family reunions, just like Christmas in Kenya.

"During the festival, the Chinese government gives all people a three-day holiday, so that they can travel to their hometown to reunite with their family members," he said.

The Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the moon-worshipping festival and the reunion festival. Since the ancient times, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, people have been worshipping and enjoying the moon, eating mooncakes, and drinking wine, among other customs passed down through generations.

"In the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, there is always a full moon, which symbolizes the reunion of the people. For those who cannot return to their hometowns, they attach their homesickness to the full moon to pray for good health, a good harvest and happiness," Zhuo said.

He said on the evening of Mid-Autumn, people lay out a big table, on which they place mooncakes, watermelons, apples, dates and grapes. After the whole family has worshipped the moon, they cut the reunion mooncakes.

UAE children's intrepid approach to new languages helps them excel in learning Chinese, according to academic

Abu Dhabi: Hundreds of Emirati schoolchildren are learning Mandarin rapidly, thanks to their uninhibited approach to trying new things in life, says a Chinese academic.

"They do well [in Mandarin learning] despite a lack of parental and social pressure to excel in it. Emirati children enjoy a more relaxed life than that of their Chinese peers," Wei Du (right), associate director of the Confucius institute at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, told Gulf News in an interview.

Some children who are not under pressure to excel in studies may lack the competitive spirit to succeed in a hypercompetitive world, but Emirati children are blessed with an unusual quality to overcome any such disadvantages, she says, adding "they are exceptionally bold in trying new things, especially in speaking a new language like Mandarin."

The Confucius institute, which promotes Chinese language worldwide, has a branch in Dubai as well.

Du said Chinese children excel in learning due to tremendous parental and social pressure. Despite their high academic performance, Chinese kids mastering English are too inhibited and shy to speak it in the initial stages of learning.

"They are afraid of making mistakes. However, Emirati children don't worry about making mistakes, so they pick up the language very fast," she said.

Compared to Chinese children, Emirati youngsters are less competitive, given that they are citizens of a resource-rich nation. But Chinese teachers are trying to take advantage of their other qualities. "They are also very tech-savvy and use electronic gadgets very well. Therefore, we use a lot of digital tools in teaching," said Du, a UAE resident of two years.

Growing relations

Mandarin is expected to become the third most important language after Arabic and English in the UAE in the future, thanks to a UAE government initiative, she said.

As Gulf News reported earlier, the initiative to teach Chinese in 100 UAE schools is underway, on the directives of His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. The first batch of 20 Chinese teachers have already started teaching in 11 schools.

Du said she was part of the selection process to pick Chinese teachers for the UAE and getting constant feedback from them about their teaching experience.

Mandarin learning is relevant in the wake of growing political and commercial ties between the UAE and China -- it is now the UAE's largest trading partner. "These Emirati students who learn Mandarin will take these relations forward." she said.

An Emirati pupil studying Chinese at Confucius institute at Zayed University told Gulf News that learning around 3,000 characters was a difficult task when he started a year ago. "Now, I can comfortably speak the language and I am trying to improve my proficiency in reading," said Sultan Salem Al Mazroui, 16, a grade 12 pupil at Adnoc School in Madinat Zayed, Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi.

"Although people say it's the toughest language in the world, this experience taught me that we can handle anything if we put our minds to it," he said.

Al Mazroui visited China twice as part of his language training and was impressed by the country's technological advancements. "They use the latest technology in everything, especially in public transport," said Al Mazroui, who attends weekend classes at the institute.

He wants to become a businessman in the future. "I want to do business with China and my language proficiency will help then," he said.

A Chinese lecturer told Gulf News that he was surprised to see that Emirati students knew many things about Chinese culture. "They ask me about Kung Fu, Chinese moon cakes and the mid-autumn festival," said Guanyang Zhang (right), 32, who arrived in the UAE just a week ago.

Student wins competition to visit China

26 Emirati pupils participate in Chinese Bridge Proficiency Competition for foreign high school students

Abu Dhabi: A UAE school pupil will visit China next year after winning the Chinese Bridge Proficiency Competition for foreign high school students, organised by the Confucius institute at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

Khalid Hamid Al Hanaee of Hamdan Bin Zayed School will travel to China as the UAE's student representative, to participate in the final international competition.

Abdul Malek Al Hakem and Hussain Al Hammadi, also from Hamdan Bin Zayed School, won second place and Wafa Rohan Khaleghian, Hareb Al Zahr, and Ruqaya Al Hassani from the same school won third place in the competition attended by 26 Emirati students from 13 public schools that teach Mandarin as part of the curriculum.

Speaking on the occasion, Lin Yaduo, deputy head of the mission at the Chinese Embassy in Abu Dhabi, said: "Mastering the Chinese language is the key to discerning China's rapid development train. It is the world's second largest economy and has the world's largest industrial, trade and foreign exchange reserves," he said.

Fatma Al Bastaki, director of Hamdan Bin Zayed School, said two pupils from her school who won the competition last year had an opportunity to visit Kunming city in China and compete with students from 105 other countries across the world.

Chinese Scholarship Recipients and their family members,

Representatives from University of Zambia and other institutions and schools,

Members of the Zambia China Students Association,

Distinguished Guests,

Friends from the Media,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good evening! Today we are very happy to get together to bid farewell to the excellent Zambian students who have been awarded the 2018 Chinese Government Scholarships. Let me, first of all, extend my warm congratulations to the recipients and their families. I know you all have worked hard at schools, and your talent, diligence and support from your families have been adequately rewarded.

It is also a great opportunity to welcome the recipients who have already finished their studies in China and come back to Zambia. Thank you for your positive contribution to the China-Zambia friendship.

I also wish to take this opportunity to thank our friends of the Zambian Government, especially for the excellent work of the Ministry of Higher Education and Higher Education Loans and Scholarship Board. With your efforts, we are able to recommend and select the best qualified students who are here today. Thank you for the job well done.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Education is one of the most important areas of cooperation between China and Zambia. At present, nearly 4,000 Zambian students are studying in China, and China has become the favorite destination for Zambian young people to study overseas. The Chinese side welcomes the Zambian students to pursue education in China. By now the Chinese government has provided over 900 government scholarships to Zambian students. And this year, I am glad to let you know that 69 Zambian students have been accepted by the Chinese universities under various scholarship programs, including 33 Zambian students under Chinese Government Scholarship program, 9 Zambian students under Youth of Excellence Scheme of China (YES CHINA) Master Program, 27 Zambian students under economy, military, and the Confucius institute Scholarship Programs.

In addition to the scholarship programs, the Chinese side is also strengthening human resources training to the Zambians, by providing a large number of training opportunities to Zambia each year. For the past 3 years, about 2,200 Zambians including civil servants, professional technicians, scholars, entrepreneurs, and media workers have been to China to participate in various types of training. This year the number would reach 920. To support the general education of Zambia, China has provided assistance for the construction of primary schools in the rural areas across Zambia, and donated equipment to Zambian schools. With the joint efforts of China and Zambia, the Confucius institute of the University of Zambia keeps promoting the teaching and learning of the Chinese language and introducing Chinese culture to the Zambian people since its establishment in 2010. More than 10,000 Zambians have learned Chinese through the Confucius institute and its classes. It has become an important platform for promoting China-Zambia cultural exchanges and cooperation.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Dear Scholarship students, you will soon embark on a journey to study in China and begin a journey of new life. Some of you will study medicine, agronomy, architecture, information technology, and some of you will study diplomacy, foreign trade, as well as Chinese, etc. Many of you have opportunities to study at the prestigious Chinese universities such as Peking University and Tsinghua University, where Chinese students are also dreaming of. I believe that you will cherish the opportunity and study very hard. After you have completed your studies, you will apply what you have learned to practical work and make positive contributions to the economic and social development of your home country of Zambia.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In two weeks' time, H.E. President Edgar Lungu will attend the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). The FOCAC Beijing Summit is under the theme of "win-win cooperation and join hands to build a closer community with a shared future for China and Africa". The Chinese side and the African side will endeavor to synergize the theme of the Summit with the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations, the Agenda 2063 of the African Union as well as the development strategies of various African countries such as the Seventh National Development Plan of Zambia, to chart a new blueprint for win-win cooperation and open up new prospects for common development.

I believe that, the FOCAC Beijing Summit will definitely provide new opportunities for China-Zambia practical cooperation, including the cooperation on education and training. This will increase the opportunities for the young generation of Zambia to study and receive training in China. It will also provide a broader space for the returned Zambian students from China to put their talents to practice. China is willing to embrace and welcome more Zambian students.

May I suggest a toast,

To the China-Zambia educational exchanges and cooperation,

To the long-lasting friendship between China and Zambia,

Cheers!

Artist-teacher Ceasar Cheng recently featured some of his works at the Solaire Resort and Casino, in an exhibit titled 'Oriental Brushstrokes II,' and sponsored by Solaire and the Confucius institute of the Ateneo de Manila University.

There were colorful paintings of eagles and peacocks, Spanish colonial churches, kalesa and fierce-looking dragons. Flowers of different kinds and colors were in evidence as well. One is bombarded with so many colors at Cheng's exhibit, and the masterful brushstrokes give the paintings a lifelike quality.

'When I was in high school, I enrolled in summer courses. It was when Taiwan sent masters to the Philippines to teach traditional Chinese painting. After that I met my teacher, Master Hau Chiok, who taught me the Lingnan style of painting,' said Cheng.

Cheng alluded to the time in the 1960s when there were Chinese painting classes in Liberty Hall in Chinatown.

Cantonese school

But the style that really influenced Cheng was the Lingnan style, taught by Hau Chiok in the 1970s. Lingnan is a region south of Guangdong, and the style highlights nature and all the life within it. The Lingnan school is also sometimes called the Cantonese school of painting.

'The Lingnan style is a combination of Western and Eastern styles,' explained Cheng. 'It is because the masters of the Lingnan style went to Japan, Europe and other places to study. So when they came back, they assimilated all those new styles in their artwork. Lingnan style is more colorful and lively. It's very different from traditional Chinese painting.'

Cheng said that he has been leaning toward more Western aesthetics in his more recent works. 'There's one painting of the iris, inspired by a painting of Van Gogh's.'

Art teacher

Cheng taught at the Confucius institute, is a founding member of International Studies for Chinese Arts, Inc. and has held art workshops at Fully Booked in Taguig.

'When I teach, I really don't tell my students what style they should adopt,' he said. 'I just teach them the basics, and then I let them develop their own.'

Moving forward, Cheng confided that his students are creating a coffee-table book featuring his artworks. 'I'm really excited about it. It will come out this year.'

Foreign policy experts say South Africa needs to be more focused now in maximising relations with its BRICS partners to realise rapid growth in all sectors.

"The biggest thing that needs to be done post this summit is that Pretoria must put its house in order so it builds pragmatic policies that will maximise on various benefits. In other words, we need to search deeper and find what we can extract from India, Brazil, Russia and China," said David Monyae, a political analyst and co-director at the University of Johannesburg's Confucius institute.

The gathering of the five presidents - Brazil's Michele Temer, Russia's Vladimir Putin, India's Narendra Modi, China's Xi Jinping and Cyril Ramaphosa - in Joburg this past week has been considered by many as South Africa's chance to increase its influence on the global stage and strengthen the country's ailing economy.

While the 10th Summit took place at a critical juncture in which China found itself at odds with the US over trade policies, Monyae said the trade spat between the two countries made the BRICS bloc more relevant than ever as it sought to assist developing countries.

Asked whether South Africa was concerned about aligning itself with countries that were in conflict with the US, Ramaphosa, addressing the media on Friday after the summit, said the BRICS countries were independent sovereign states who were not dictated to on who they should be friends with.

Monyae concurred: "State affairs are not about the feelings of the other person. President Ramaphosa is right in saying we have to protect our own interests. Certainly, our relationship with the US is not good. In fact, it is at its worst particularly now under Donald Trump's administration.

"He doesn't take African countries seriously. While we may be affected by these so-called trade wars to some extent, China is our biggest trading partner and the second-biggest in the world.

"Therefore we have to nurture this relationship."

While China undoubtedly remained a dominant figure over the last couple of days with Xi promising a $14.7 billion (R194bn) investment in South Africa, another international relations expert felt the participation by the three other countries could have been better.

Professor Garth le Pere, executive director of the Institute of Global Dialogue, said: "Looking at the BRICS agnostics, when China sneezes, BRICS catches the cold. But when it comes to Temer and Modi, I don't think they have BRICS running in their veins.

"India struggles to play second fiddle to China and has sought to compete with it in various forms. Intra-BRICS tensions exist and can't be ignored but... I think South Africa is looking at the bigger picture and wants to be the country that serves as a normative glue between the different states," said.

Ramaphosa, who held multi-bilateral talks with Russia and other BRICS states as well as meeting Turkey's leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, reiterated that the nuclear power deal with Russia would not happen right now.

"On nuclear, we said because our economy is not participating at a level we would like it to and have huge financial constraints, we are not able to proceed with a nuclear build programme.

"President Putin was relaxed about this and says that we (must) deal with our issues, and when the situation changes we can talk and that's where we left it."

While the 10th summit took place at a critical juncture in which China finds itself at odds with the US over trade policies, Monyae said the trade wars between the two had heightened the relevance of the BRICS bloc as it sought to assist developing countries.

Asked whether South Africa was not worried about aligning itself with countries that were in conflict with the US, addressing the media on Friday, Ramphosa said the BRICS countries were sovereign states and no one could dictate who they should be friends with.

Monyae agreed that affairs of state were not about the feelings of another party. He said Ramaphosa was right to say we needed to protect our own interests.

South Africa's relations with the US were at their worst since the Trump administration came in as the US leader didn't take African countries seriously, he added.

"While we might be affected by the so-called trade wars, China is South Africa's biggest trading partner and has the world's second-biggest economy, so we have to nurture this relationship."

The three-day gathering held at the Sandton Convention Centre largely focused on the Fourth Industrial Revolution with all leaders strongly advocating strong economic ties and the promotion of multilateralism while denouncing anti-globilisation rhetoric.

It also looked at the significant role the BRICS development bank played in issuing loans to the countries for social development.

The summit gave several African states an opportunity to contribute through an outreach session.

While China was the dominant figure over the past few days with Xi promising a $14.7 billion investment in South Africa, another international relations expert felt participation by the three other countries could have been better.

"Looking at the BRICS agnostics, when China sneezes, BRICS catches the cold. But when it comes to Temer and Modi, I don't think they have BRICS running in their veins. India struggles to play second fiddle to China and has sought to compete with it in various forms. Intra-BRICS tensions exist and can't be ignored, but I think South Africa is looking at the bigger picture and wants to be the country that serves as normative glue between the states," said Professor Garth Le Pere, executive director of the Institute of Global Dialogue.

Le Pere said it was clear BRICS was working hard to reshape its role and the influence it wanted to have on a global scale.

But he said the term for which BRICS allowed a country to chair the bloc needed to be extended to three years.

"One year is not enough to undertake most of the projects outlined. By the time we get to Brazil for the next summit, we will have forgotten the Johannesburg declaration."

Meanwhile, Ramaphosa, who held multi bilateral talks with Russia and other BRICS states, as well as met Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, reiterated that the nuclear power deal with Russia would not go ahead right now.

"Because our economy is not at a level we'd like and we have huge financial constraints, we are not able to proceed with the nuclear build programme. President Putin was relaxed about this and said we should deal with our issues and when the situation changed we could talk again and that's where we left it," he said.

Le Pere said as a result of Ramaphosa's firm stance on his plans for the country, Putin might have newfound respect for him - a characteristic reinforced by the summit as he managed to pull off a successful event and displayed excellent statesmanship.

Some projects the BRICS countries would now embark on included establishing a BRICS vaccine centre based in Joburg.

Ramaphosa's spokesperson, Khusela Diko, said the decision to create such a centre followed the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. She said the centre would conduct thorough research that would be used to tackle the burden of diseases across the five nations as well as in developing countries.

Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has issued the following press release:

The Seventh China-Africa Think Tanks Forum kicked off in Beijing on July 4. David Monyae, President of the Confucius institute with the University of Johannesburg, said at the forum that China's reform and opening up is a great project starting from 1978 and has created miracles over the past 40 years. The year of 1955 is also very important. The Bandung Conference was held that year and left the Bandung Spirit. China, Africa and all developing countries came together to resist the world order dominated by the United States. China and Africa share a glorious history of fighting against imperialism and have potentials to further cooperation. The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation is very important as we can conduct more cooperation under the framework, for example, learning from China's rich experience of dealing with poverty and debt issues.

Chinese investment in Africa is doing well. The Chinese Government pledged to invest $100 billion in Africa in the next few years during the FOCAC Johannesburg Summit in 2015. I know that China and Africa have another grand cooperation plan: the Belt and Road Initiative. We hope the Belt and Road Initiative will help get involving African people out of poverty and the initiative could be aligned with Africa's Agenda 2063. We hope we could move forward on infrastructure construction. And these are things on the minds of our African countries. We also hope the Belt and Road Initiative could turn African's bulk commodities into finished products, and we could see more Chinese-African joint ventures working to advance the industrialization in Africa. These are the key areas I think about.

China has achieved tremendous achievements in science and technology. We also heard some criticism from Western countries, which made some ungrounded accusation against China. In fact, Africa is well aware that China has entered the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and we hope we could go hand in hand with China. The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, and the Organization of African Unity was established in 1963. The two will celebrate their respective centennial anniversaries in 2049 and 2063 when we expect our respective economy to achieve leapfrogging development. Now, China and Africa are working to realize the goals. How to overcome obstacles on the road ahead and how to achieve these goals are not only the responsibilities of politicians, but also of the academic circles. We will advance our work with our knowledge for the benefits of the people in the African continent.

"Until only 15 years ago in Chile, the Chinese language was considered property of the Eastern world, impossible to learn for all of us. Today we have seen that it is possible, these 17 young people are showing us their great oratory and artistic skills in this language, "said Education Minister Gerardo Varela in the final stage of the course " Chinese Bridge " through which students of municipal and subsidized private schools will show their artistic and idiomatic skills of the Asian country on Monday and Tuesday.

The contest organized 11 years ago between Mineduc and the Confucius institute of the Universidad Santo Tomas, and sponsored by the Chinese Embassy in Chile, seeks to elect the best Chilean representatives for the World Final in Yunnan, China.

In 2004, in the context of APEC, Mineduc signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China. This agreement initiated the teaching of Mandarin Chinese in public high schools. Since then, Mandarin Chinese teaching has expanded to more establishments interested in this language.

The aim of the project is to offer the students of the municipal system the possibility of studying a second language as a foreign language and to contribute to the formation of students with a wider worldview and with the adequate knowledge to continue studying Mandarin Chinese in the future , due to the relations we have with the Asian giant and the need to communicate better with our Chinese counterpart.

For this version the participants come from the Metropolitan, Valparaso, O'Higgins, Biobo, Los Ros and Magallanes regions. The contest takes place in more than 120 countries, and it is the first two scores of each of them who can travel to China and share with students from different parts of the world.

"All these initiatives are building the concrete bases of what will be in the near future the ties between Chile and China, in political, economic, educational and social spheres. Integration into the world is an important challenge for children and young people today, "the minister concluded.

Welcome to the new Chinese Embassy. We are pleased to hold today's Chinese competition and look forward to the great performances of all the participants. Let me take this opportunity to extend my thanks to the Confucius institute for their professional teaching and organizing this activity.

This is my second time to join such a Chinese competition event, for which I have a special preference because it offers a chance for me to directly interact with Eritrean young students and I can hear their fresh thoughts and ideas, especially their understanding of China and the Chinese culture.

Culture is where a country and its people's spiritual sources and souls lie. Trans-cultural exchanges play an irreplaceable role in strengthening state-to-state bilateral relations, enhancing friendship between different countries and peoples and fostering connectivity for peoples' hearts. Over the past years China and Eritrea have conducted frequent people-to-people exchanges and cultural cooperation. This has subsequently made positive contribution to our bilateral ties as well as the friendship between the two peoples.

Last year, I visited an elementary school in Asmara and talked to the pupils in their classroom. Through our dialogues, it became apparent to me that they have profound interests in China and Chinese culture because they raised so many questions about China's history and culture to me, and some of them tried their best to greet me in Chinese, which was of course not so fluent or standardized in pronunciation and intonation, like and so on. But I understood them well and I felt they were so close to me when they spoke Chinese. Yes, different languages should not become obstacles for our communication, and learning each other's language and culture constitutes a "golden key" to effective communication. It can greatly shorten our distances and let us feel each other's hearts.

But a contest is a contest, it is about selecting the winners through fierce competition, and the winners of this contest will have the opportunity to represent Eritrea to participate in the final Chinese contest in China this October. But for me there are no losers among you, you are all winners. This is because you not only work hard to learn Chinese, show your confidence and courage on this stage, but more importantly because each of you is an emissary for China-Eritrea relations, and you will serve as a bridge of friendship and mutual understanding between our peoples. You are all ambassadors among the general public.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of China-Eritrea diplomatic relations, and our cooperation in various fields including culture and education ushers in important opportunities. This September, China will hold the Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). This Summit will outline new China-Africa cooperation plans. I'm sure that promoting educational and cultural exchanges will be an important part of those plans.

Chinese civilization has a 5000-year uninterrupted history. Eritrea also has a long history of ethnic, cultural and religious developments. China is ready to stick to principles of inclusiveness, openness and mutual learning to invigorate its bilateral ties with Eritrea in language and cultural aspects, in order to make our joint contribution to the progress of human civilization and the building of a shared future of common destiny for the mankind.

To conclude my remarks, let me extend my best wishes again to all the participants for good performances, and also for success in the following-up competitions in China.

The institute has played a pivotal role in making Pakistani students aware of Chinese language and culture as well as mutual exchange of students. The exemplary progress made by China in science and technology is a lesson of Pakistan since Pakistan must learn from Chinese experiences and strive for the eradication of poverty.

These views were expressed by KU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Ajmal Khan while delivering the presidential address at 5th anniversary ceremony of Confucius institute, University of Karachi organized by Confucius institute, University of Karachi (KU) at ICCBS auditorium KU.

State institutes for further education are preparing to teach Chinese after the summer, director of the institutes Loizos Anastasiades said on Monday.

"This is part of an agreement made during the education minister's visit to China in May 2017," he said. "We are now preparing for the classes together with the University of Cyprus."

The lessons will be in the official language of China, standard Chinese, which is a form of Mandarin, and the institutes will work with the University of Cyprus Confucius institute.

To start with the institute will give the lessons, but Anastasiades said additional instructors from elsewhere could eventually be used, depending on demand from children and adults.

Former education minister Costas Kadis made a series of agreements during his visit to China from May 13 to 18 2017 to strengthen educational ties between the two countries. One of them provided for mutual recognition of university titles.

Under another agreement signed in 2012 the two countries pledged to support the exchange of scholarship students and the co-hosting of linguistic research.

They also agreed to conduct linguistic research into each other's languages and to teach the respective languages to students in higher education.

The director of the state institutes believes last year's agreement and the planned introduction of Chinese language lessons for the academic year 2018/2019 are likely the result of growing demand.

According to President Anastasiades, bilateral relations between the two countries have grown in the fields of investment, tourism, energy, commerce and technology.

Investors from China live mostly in the Paphos region where many have bought real estate and obtained Cypriot citizenship under the government's scheme to allow investors to obtain naturalisation.

China's Ambassador to Sierra Leone has reckoned that the Chinese language would serve as the bridge between the China-Sierra Leone cultural exchange and facilitate Sierra Leoneans to explore China's time-honoured history.

Ambassador Wu Peng was speaking on Saturday, May 26, at the Mary Kingsley Auditorium at Fourah Bay College during the 17th Chinese Bridge-Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign College Students organised by the Confucius institute.

The competition, which is sponsored by the Chinese Embassy in Sierra Leoone, is regarded as a significant platform for college students across the world to study mandarin Chinese.

According to Ambassador Wu Peng, the Chinese language will effectively promote Sierra Leonean cultural dissemination to China, thus driving people-to-people, business-to-business exchanges between the two countries.

He congratulated the ten contenders for making it to the final of the competition and expressed firm belief that in the foreseeable future they would be able to serve as envoys of China-Sierra Leone cultural exchanges.

"The Chinese bridge competition has gained its great momentum over the years as an increasing number of people in Sierra Leone and around the world start to learn the Chinese language and be willing to show their talents," he said.

Ambassador Wu stated that the theme for this year's competition: 'One World, One Family' has a special meaning for everyone as they always hold the belief that China and Africa belong to a community of a shared future.

He added that over the past decades the two countries have always been good friends, who stand together through thick and thin despite changes in the international landscape.

Also speaking, the institute's local director, Kenneth Osho, said the competition serves as a bridge to promote cultural exchanges between China and the outside world.

"The Chinese Bridge Proficiency is a large-scale international competition between students at various levels of their education," he said.

Osho explained that the competition aims at arousing enthusiasm in students from various countries to learn the Chinese language and broaden their horizon in the culture and history of the People's Republic of China.

Meanwhile, the eleven students who competed in the final phase of the competition delivered wonderful speeches based on their individual experience and understanding of the theme: "One World, One Family".

At the end of the competition, Alpha Bangura emerged as champion and will represent Sierra Leone at the final contest in China later this year.

Over the weekend, hundreds of university students gathered at the University of Rwanda's College of Education (formerly Kigali Institute of Education) for the Rwanda finals of the Chinese Bridge Competition, a Chinese language proficiency competition.

The annual Chinese Bridge Competition gives an opportunity to college students to display their Chinese Mandarin language skills in form of a prepared speech, a cultural question-and-answer session, as well as a cultural performance of their chosen skill.

This year saw around 700 students come together to compete in the Rwanda semi-finals of the Chinese Bridge Competition; of these semifinalists the top nine contestants went through to the Rwanda finals.

The diversity of performances and level of language proficiency skills were exceptional, with performances ranging from traditional Chinese fan dances to self-composed musical pieces. All the contestants brought their own style and flair to the competition.

After months of hard work and preparation under the guidance of an assigned university Confucius institute teacher, the students presented themselves in front of a panel of judges.

All of the finalists demonstrated a high level of understanding Chinese Mandarin, extensive knowledge of Chinese culture and history, as well as exhibited their creativity in their use and knowledge of the language.

In the end, only the top two were selected and awarded with trophies as well as a trip to China to participate in the international competition, which is expected to take place in summer, either in July or August.

Charles Ntakiyimana emerged the overall winner while Irene Musengamana was the first runner-up, and both of them will get sponsored trips to China, organisers said.

Ntakiyimana will officially represent Rwanda at the final stage, while the latter will only get a sponsored tour to China.

"To learn Chinese requires you a lot of efforts and this is why I cried when they announced me as the winner. But Chinese is my favourite language and this is why I have been learning it for the past two years," Ntakiyimana told The New Times.

The top winner is a third year Engineering student at University of Rwanda's College of Science and Technology. He dedicated the award to the Confucius institute teachers who facilitated him throughout the process.

He will join hundreds of other representatives from over 140 countries across the world in the global competition.

This year, the Chinese Embassy in Rwanda partnered with the College of Education's Confucius institute to host the 17th edition of the competition. Rao Hongwei, the Chinese ambassador to Rwanda, said the competition has become an ideal platform for lovers of Chinese language.

"The Chinese Bridge competition has become an annual gathering for lovers of Chinese language worldwide. On this platform, a large number of talented contestants have emerged," he told the participants on Sunday.

Hongwei highlighted that there had been a growing enthusiasm for learning Chinese in Rwanda. For instance, the Confucius institute in Rwanda has expanded Chinese teaching posts to 10 this year and has attracted more than 4,200 registered students.

Charles Murigande, deputy vice chancellor at the University of Rwanda, told the students that it was important to learn Chinese language as it would unlock more opportunities in the near future.

Two students of the University of Ghana, Jacqueline Sekyi and Duncan Acorlor have emerged winners in the 17th Chinese Bridge preliminary competition held at the Confucius institute in Accra.

Ms Sekyi won the first prize and received a return ticket to China to witness the finals of the Bridge competition while, Acorlor who emerged winner of the special prize award and popularity award also received a return ticket to represent Ghana in the finals of the competition in China.

Ten students, drawn from the Confucius institute at UG, University of Cape Coast (UCC) and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) took part in the national competition which saw the duo putting up some impressive performances to the delight of judges and the audience.

Students competed in series of tests, including Chinese and Ghanaian talent shows, oral recitation in Chinese as well as answering spontaneous questions in the Chinese language.

Speaking in an interview with the media, an exhilarated Acorlor, said his victory was as a result of hardwork and determination.

Confucius institute at the Suez Canal University has organized a training program for the Egyptian and Chinese employees of China's fiberglass giant Jushi which operates in the Suez Canal region to develop their administrative and leading skills and boost their knowledge of the Egyptian and the Chinese cultures.

The two-day program, which kicked off on Saturday, includes a series of lectures given by Egyptian and Chinese instructors, in addition to sports and mental exercises.

"The Jushi staff join this training program to develop their skills and learn how to deal with the different situations they face at work," Abdel-Rahman, who has been working for Jushi since 2012, told Xinhua at the Confucius institute.

"The Chinese have old civilization but they did not only rely on that. They have now technology and development and they have become a world economic power," the Egyptian man said.

Jushi Egypt is a tenant company of China's TEDA corporation, one of the oldest and largest industrial developers of the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) in Ain Sokhna district in Ismailia.

Abdel-Rahman, who has become a deputy department chief in Jushi, said he learned a lot of skills in the company, such as leadership and making best use of available resources.

"They think outside of the box to turn difficult situations into favorable ones," he noted.

Jushi usually holds internal training programs for its staff, but the program at the Confucius institute is the first external one for them.

"The Suez Canal region is the future of Egyptian economy. Through our communication with Chinese companies operating in the SCZone, we found their need to organize such a training program, the first of its kind to be held by Confucius institute," said Hassan Ragab, the director of Confucius institute at the Suez Canal University.

"The two-day program focuses on skill development of Jushi's Chinese and Egyptian staff. It also develops their skills in teamwork, leadership and alternative troubleshooting planning," the director told Xinhua.

According to Ragab, the program teaches both Chinese and Egyptians how to deal with each other and raise their awareness of Egyptian and Chinese civilizations "as they are close cultures and among the world's oldest civilizations."

"We will continue providing such training programs for about 20 Chinese companies operating in the SCZone. Jushi is just the beginning," Ragab said.

"Our program is a humble contribution to enhancing ties of Confucius institute and the Suez Canal University with Chinese companies."

Ragab, who received his PhD in Chinese literature in China and lived in the giant Asian country for five years, explained that such programs are supported by Confucius institute in Beijing which urges communication with overseas Chinese companies as representatives of the Chinese culture.

"China is the world's factory with a dominant and brilliant future in the 21st century," the Confucius institute director concluded.

With the help of Jushi, Egypt has become the world's third largest producer of fiberglass after the United States and China.

Song Bo, the educational counselor at the Chinese embassy in Cairo, said such kind of training program will benefit both Chinese and Egyptian employees at Jushi for a better understanding of each other's cultures.

"The important lesson is that a multi-national company should eliminate the cultural barriers within its employees to maximize their efficiency," Song said.

The Islamabad High Court has issued notice to Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) in the alleged case of illegal appointment of two professors at School of Politics and International Relations (SPIR).

Confucius institute Director and Punjab University Political Science Assistant Professor Dr Rana Ijaz Ahmad had challenged these appointments in his writ petition before the IHC.

Justice Athar Minallah while hearing this petition on Friday ruled that notice be issued to QAU, its vice chancellor and other respondents for filing report and para-wise comments within a fortnight.

The order acknowledges the petitioner's grievance on count of discarding a transparent process which was initiated for filling the post advertised in March 2016 and his counsel's plea that the process of scrutiny is in progress and QAU has initiated a summary for the appointments of two professors against the advertised posts.

The said posts of two professors at SPIR were initially advertised in March 2013. However, the syndicate subsequently decided to re-advertise these positions after an inquiry conducted by a member of Federal Public Service Commission and QAU Selection Board revealed serious irregularities in the appointment process.

The then registrar of QAU was suspended for committing these and other irregularities at the university.

Dr Ahmed is one of the applicants for the re-advertised posts, and his immediate reason for seeking judicial remedy in this case is the decision earlier this month by the syndicate and its sub-committee to appoint two SPIR faculty members as professors, who are neither the applicants for the re-advertised posts nor recommended by the selection board for such appointments, as per the above petition.

The Liberia National Wushu Association in collaboration with the Confucius institute at the University of Liberia and the Chinese Embassy near Monrovia officially opened the newly constructed Liberia-China Wushu School and Gymnasium on Saturday, January 6.

The president of the Liberia National Wushu Association, Fred J. A. Pratt, said the official turning over of modernized Wushu School marked another milestone in the Liberian sporting arena.

According to him, the project was constructed by the government and people of China through its embassy in Monrovia in partnership with the LNWA.

The official turning over of the newly constructed Liberia-China Wushu School brought together dignitaries from the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of State and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia, the Police Inspector General and Foreign Service Director as some of the high profile personalities who graced the occasion.

President Pratt noted that the cultural exchange performance between China and Liberia martial arts athletes was indeed a sign of recognizing the people of China for their pivotal role played over the years in the growth and development of Liberia.

According to him, Wushu has actively been involved in training and recruiting young Liberians at the SKD Sports Complex. He lauded Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yue for his commitment to the exchange of martial arts program to other parts of Liberia.

Responding, Ambassador Zhang said martial arts performances between Liberia and Chinese athletes are welcome as they build a strong relationship between Liberia and China, pointing out that the people of China will remain supportive of Liberia's development and help to strengthen the capacity of the Liberia National Wushu Association.

It may be recalled that Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yue pledged his government's continued support to the Liberian National Wushu Association last year during the Wushu awareness competition held on the main campus of the University of Liberia in Monrovia.

That program was organized by the LNWA in collaboration with the 4th UNMIL Chinese Police (FPU) and the Confucius institute at the University of Liberia.

At Saturday's program, the Confucius institute at the University of Liberia was one of the major actors during the martial arts performance as the students and their Chinese counterparts performed traditional dances to entertain the large crowd.

The Award was presented to Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh in recognition of his outstanding and invaluable service to the Confucius institute and to his role in enhancing Sino-Arab relations in all fields in addition to his efforts in achieving the goals of the Belt and Road initiative launched in 2013 by Chinese President HE Mr. Xi Jinping. This initiative is considered to be a development strategy that builds cooperation among countries mainly between China and Eurasian countries; it refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road.

The Award was handed by Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China Dr. Liu Yandong to Mr. Luay Abu-Ghazaleh, chairman of TAG-Confucius and Vice President of Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization at the opening ceremony of the 12th Confucius institute Conference which was held in Xi'an, China.

 THE warning bell is ringing on China's global effort to suppress Western values and undermine the freedoms enjoyed in the world's democracies. Beijing has baited some of America's leading corporations with offers of access to its giant consumer market. In return, the likes of Apple and LinkedIn have agreed to play by China's rules and submit to what amounts to censorship. On American college campuses, accepting money from the Beijing-backed Confucius institute has come at the price of academic freedom: There are mounting concerns that the language and cultural centres financed by the institute prohibit discussion on issues that place China in a critical light. Elsewhere, Beijing has been accused of pulling the strings of Western democracies. In Australia, Chinese businessmen with ties to the Chinese Communist Party have donated millions of dollars to the country's two leading political parties in an effort to shape domestic and foreign policy. A rising political star, Sam Dastyari of the opposition Labour Party, announced his resignation from the Senate in the face of allegations that he was peddling Beijing's positions for financial support. But what might first appear to be signs of Beijing's rising power are proving to be strategic missteps for China. Beijing is overreaching and starting to burn bridges across the West and in the developing world. After two decades of expanding engagement and economic ties with Australia, China is now watching as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is overhauling his country's espionage and foreign interference laws in part to counter Chinese influence. Despite President Trump's warm reception in Beijing last month during a state visit, the United States government has designated China as a competitor in its new national security strategy and is weighing an expansion of the Foreign Agents and Registration Act to curb propaganda and disinformation from Chinese state media and think tanks. Even in the European Union, China's largest trading partner, Beijing has caused anxieties to spike. Germany's intelligence agency recently accused China of mining the personal data of German politicians and diplomats. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Danish prime minister and NATO chief, as well as a free-trade-loving Scandinavian, asked the European Union to create measures to investigate and potentially restrict Chinese investments on the Continent. This position echoes that of other European leaders who argue Beijing has kept the door closed to foreign investment in too many sectors of its economy while exploiting the openness of European markets and snatching up leading European technology companies over the past few years. Demands are growing that Beijing offer equal treatment to European companies in China. China's"One Belt, One Road" initiative, a grandiose trillion-dollar trade and investment strategy to reconnect Eurasia and position China at the centre of the global economy, is also facing resistance. While the United States is only now waking up to the threat from Chinese money to its democracy, the developing world has long known the extent to which Beijing is willing to influence politics and societies abroad. Pakistan, a pivotal country in the plan, has begun to question the extent and terms of its involvement, recently shelving a $14 billion hydropower dam project it felt was too costly. In Myanmar, a critical land link into China from the Indian Ocean, officials have been questioning the notion that the same large and expensive infrastructure projects that helped fuel China's economic growth will serve as vehicles for its own development. In Latin America, China's global infrastructure drive has faced local demands to be more sensitive to environmental concerns, such as in Argentina, where President Mauricio Macri pushed Beijing to shrink the footprint of the hydropower dams it was building in that country. China also faced protests in Africa after Chinese construction firms have failed to conduct due diligence on land acquisition and local employment before pushing forward with new railway and road projects. Backlash is likely in Sri Lanka as well. After accepting Beijing's talk of"win-win development," and amassing billions in Chinese loans, the Sri Lankan government recently ceded control of the strategic port of Hambantota to Beijing for a 99-year lease in return for debt forgiveness. But few tenants love their landlord, particularly one that is charging you rent to live on your own land. Prominent politicians have already accused the Sri Lankan government of selling the country's sovereignty to Beijing. In light of this resistance, 2018 may very well see new efforts to tackle the challenge from China. Beijing's recent intrusions may prompt more security cooperation among the so-called Quad in the Asia-Pacific: the United States, India, Japan and Australia. Japan and India are particularly keen to find new ways to counter China's hegemony over Asia's waterways. And looking to make its trade less dependent on China, Europe will put a stronger focus on other large economic partners. It has already signed a new free trade agreement with Japan that will account for 40 percent of global trade. It should be no surprise that authoritarian powers are not good at making friends, particularly with democracies, which favour open markets and freedom of speech. If Beijing seeks to calm concerns in the West over its influence in politics and society, it may need to revamp its policy that prioritises economic gains. Instead, China would be well served to consider its own history of resentment regarding outside intervention, and look to build new cooperation and compromise with the West. Beijing is gradually building warmer relations with Tokyo based on economic and social cooperation. This may offer a path forward for Beijing to overcome its differences with Western democracies, to disengage from political interference, and to refocus on building partnerships that can expand the trade and investment that brought it to the heights of the global economy in the first place. China leaves 2017 with frayed relations across much of the West. If it does not pull back from these intrusions on Western democracies, the overreach will ultimately reduce China's global power.

CPEC offers opportunities of growth for SMEs

Speakers emphasised that the topic is very relevant, dynamic with the changing geo-political scenario. Speakers came into light multiple interesting impacts regarding cordial relationship between the two countries.

One of these amazing facts is that out of total 65 countries connected under the OBOR project, 55 are Muslim countries. It manifests a deep sense of Chinese trust in Muslim world.

With these growing engagements in the field of science and technology especially infrastructural projects included in CPEC, government of both the countries need to pay attention towards cultural sensitivity of both the nations.

They said that the people have to recognise and understand different cultural sensitivities between China and Pakistan. When two civilisations interact, there is a fear of amalgamation of smaller one into the larger one and where each civilisation has to be cautious about the cultural sensitivities especially that of smaller civilisation.

CPEC Cultural Caravan to boost connectivity

If proper measures are not adopted, indigenous cultures were at the risk of degradation. In this respect, cordiality of the relationship demands that the larger civilisation should be very cautious about the idiosyncrasies of smaller civilisation.

Cultural awareness is yet to happen at larger stage in order to cope with this challenge, speakers emphasized. By: and large, there are some other economic fears that need to be addressed.

Chinese cultural performances along with local traditional dances highlighted the celebrations here on Saturday to mark the third anniversary of the establishment of the Confucius institute in Uganda.

The programs showed a harmony between the two different cultures of China and Uganda. Officials attending the event agreed that the Confucius institute set up in the Makerere University, which is Uganda's oldest and top university, has contributed a lot to cooperation between the two countries.

Chu Maoming, deputy Chinese ambassador to Uganda, said the institute has built a bridge to connect the two peoples through language learning and cultural exchange.

"It has become a window through which the Ugandan people come to know more about China. It has boosted bilateral exchange," Chu said.

"With this we will see greater contributions made to boost China-Uganda educational cooperation, people-to-people exchange and development of bilateral friendly relationship," said Chu.

He advised Ugandan students to learn the Chinese language well and make a use of this in the East African country's future development.

"Use what you have learned to deepen mutual understanding between China and Uganda, helping them to become friends and reliable partners," the Chinese diplomat said.

Barnabas Nawangwe, vice chancellor of the Makerere University, said he is looking forward to building a Chinese cultural center in the campus to enhance Uganda-China cooperation.

"I am looking forward to having a Chinese cultural center here. This will attract the people who want to study and know more about Chinese culture," said Nawangwe.

Oswald Ndoleriire, Ugandan-side director of the Confucius institute, said the institute, launched in December 2014, has now over 70 students enrolled for Chinese language degree courses and over 4,000 more for short-term courses.

Griffith Asia Institute has issued the following press release:

The region's foremost experts in tourism will converge at the Marriott hotel in Surfers Paradise this week for the third annual East-West Dialogue on Tourism and the Chinese Dream conference.

Spearheaded by the Griffith Institute for Tourism (GIFT) and Griffith Tourism Confucius institute (TCI), the three-day event will be held from Thursday 23 November through Saturday 25 November, and explore a diversity of issues facing the contemporary Asia-Pacific tourism market, unified under the need to address the topic of managing tourism in a way that supports sustainable growth.

The conference will feature opening speeches on the Friday from Tourism Australia chairman and Mantra Group chief executive Bob East, and Griffith University Vice Chancellor Professor Ian O'Connor AC, with an official welcome from Professor Bin Dai, the CEO of the China Tourism Academy, and a dinner keynote from former Tourism Australia and Tourism Queensland chair Don Morris AO.

Also on the keynote speakers bill are an array of international industry leaders including International Academy for the Study of Tourism fellow Professor Jigang Bao, senior marketing professional Vanessa Brennan (PwC Australia), New Zealand-based environmental scientist Professor Ken Hughey and University of South Australia Professor of Tourism Marianna Sigala, among others.

The core focus at this year's Tourism and the Chinese Dream summit is particularly timely, not only because 2017 has been declared as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, but also due to its significance as the China-Australia Year of Tourism, which celebrates the two countries' close bilateral relationship.

The Gold Coast is an ideal location in which to canvass such ideas, Professor Becken said. As the recipient of nearly half a million visitors from China each year, the city is regarded as the country's favourite Australian port of call, and was the only Western location to make the global top ten list of preferred Chinese tourism destinations in a recent survey by travel services provider Ctrip.

Professor Susanne Becken

However, the academic scope of the Dialogue goes well beyond just its eponymous nations.

"Tourism is growing at an incredible rate," conference co-convenor and GIFT Director Professor Susanne Becken said. "Chinese visitors to Australia have grown a lot, so in some ways it's a great case study, but there will be participants from New Zealand and from Europe and North America as it's happening everywhere in the world."

"How do you manage all of that growth in a sustainable way? That's our overarching theme: How can we harness this opportunity sustainably and responsibly, and what do governments need to do, what do businesses need to do, how does technology play into that?"

In addition to its array of speeches, the conference will include a series of panel discussions examining the plethora of opportunities and challenges facing contemporary tourism, such as how best to attract visitors through destination marketing, managing dispersal to encourage sustainable industry and environmental outcomes, the technological trends, risks and insights changing the face of international tourism, industry impact on community well-being, and far-reaching topics such as policy, trade and geopolitics.

Accra, Oct 30, 2017 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media) -- The maiden Chinese song contest for non-native speakers took place at Ghana's Port City of Tema on Friday.

The competition, which was organized by the Confucius institute at the University of Ghana, attracted the interest of citizens of both countries.

Twelve groups of singers who were selected following a vigorous preliminary race took part in the contest. After two rounds of powerful contest, Margaret Clement, who is a student of the Confucius institute, was adjudged the overall winner of the competition, after leaving the judges and the audience spellbound with her powerful rendition of traditional Chinese songs.

She impressed the five-member panel of judges with her lively show on the afternoon held at the Niuniu Club in Tema.

"I really worked hard for it," an excited Clement told Xinhua.

"What is special about this competition is that I competed with people who are majoring in the Chinese language. I'm not majoring in Chinese but still I made it. That is one of the many things that made the whole thing beautiful," she said.

Clement believes the event would motivate her to learn new Chinese words, master the language and improve her confidence when speaking the language to people.

Sandra Naa Ayerley Quaye, a student of the University of Ghana, who emerged joint second runner-up, encouraged Ghanaians to take up interest in learning the Chinese language and culture.

She said learning and singing Chinese songs has helped her to learn more words faster and improve on her academic performance.

"Every time you sing a song, you learn a new word. I once sang a song and I went to the class and the teacher used the word and I was like oh I know it. I was the only one who was able to say it and it was a motivation for me," she told Xinhua.

The 2017 Chinese song contest was on the theme: "Chinese Dream Inspired by the Silk Road."

The theme aims to provide a platform for the students learning Chinese to display their good command of the language, their deep love for Chinese songs, and their recognized talents in singing.

Mei Meilian, the Chinese Director of the Confucius institute at the University of Ghana, was highly impressed by the contestants' performances displayed during the competition.

"They did wonderfully. I'm very proud of them," she told Xinhua.

Jinhua, Oct 26, 2017 (Cameroon Tribune/All Africa Global Media) -- The school boasts over 10,000 learners in the country and cooperates with 8 local universities.

Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua in southeastern China's Zhejiang Province was founded over 60 years ago. The Institute of African Studies, Zhejiang Normal University, IASZNU, was introduced in the 1990s. Today, Zhejiang Normal University, ZNU, cooperates with over 30 African universities and some institutes. The university has established three Confucius institutes in Africa - Cameroon, Tanzania and Mozambique.

The institute in Cameroon will next year celebrate its 10th anniversary, officials explained to Cameroon Tribune in Jinhua recently during a visit by 27 African journalists. Meanwhile, over 10,000 Cameroonians are learning Chinese in Yaounde, Douala and Maroua, Prof. Chen Mingkun, Deputy Director of the Institute of African Studies disclosed. Confucius institute Cameroon also has ties with 8 local universities and private schools that teach Chinese.

The University of Maroua last year became the first in West Africa to graduate teachers in Chinese Language Education. So far, 200 teachers have graduated from the programme whose Head of Department trained in Zhejiang Normal University. ZNU each year admits about 1,000 African students, including nearly 100 Cameroonians.

Meanwhile, Zhejiang Normal University offered to train Cameroonian civil engineers for free so that they can return home and boost the local construction industry. However, there have prolonged delays in receiving feedback from the University of Yaounde I that was requested to send names. "The Director of IASZNU is eagerly looking forward to getting this cooperation project off the ground," an official told Cameroon Tribune.

Meanwhile, two Cameroonian are studying for doctorate degrees in IASZNU, all on Chinese government scholarships.

- The multibillion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), seen as a game changer for Pakistan, has given an impetus to Chinese language learning in the city.

Many institutions are offering Chinese language courses. Many public and private universities are establishing Chinese learning centres to meet the growing demand for Chinese language institutions in Pakistan.

The Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta) has dedicated 47 institutes in 23 districts of Punjab to Chinese language teaching.

Punjab University's Confucius institute offers Chinese language courses twice a year. The University of Central Punjab has established a well-equipped Chinese Lab donated by the Chinese Consulate and become the first varsity to get the donation of Chinese Language Lab to cater to the increasing demand for the Chinese language. Chinese language courses are also being offered at the Punjab Chiangso Cultural Centre, NUML University and Chinese Language Centre at the Department of Humanities, University of Engineering and Technology.

The Government College University spokesman told this newspaper that a number of students were enrolling in Chinese language course at GCU's Centre for Excellence in China Studies. He said two in-house Chinese instructors were teaching at the centre. 'Our study centre currently has more than 100 students with two sessions a year. Catering to the demand for the academia and the industry, the varsity is committed to promoting the Chinese and Pakistan linguistic ties so that our students can contribute to the multibillion dollar CPEC project,' he said.

Abdullah Zaeem Quraishi, who completed his Chinese language course from Tevta Chinese Learning Centre, told The Nation, 'It's hard to express my success story. After completing my software engineering and MBA, I could not find a job. Then I did a three-month Chinese language course from Tevta. Now I am earning a handsome amount.'

Abdullah said, 'Currently, I'm working with Habib Construction as Chinese translator.' He said that when he heard about the CPEC and the ensuing boom in the industry he got admission to a diploma programme because he knew this would help him. He said that Chinese industry was taking interest in setting up plants in Pakistan, so they would definitely need skilled manpower and human resources.

Khalid, a GCU student, said it had been a tremendous journey and lifetime experience studying at GCU's Chinese Language Centre. 'Keeping in view the CPEC project, students are taking interest in Chinese language, which is a quite sweet language,' he said.

Mehwish Hayaat, who was once a student of Chinese language, now works as Chinese language instructor at a government institution. 'I have done B.Com. I applied for job in multiple sectors for different positions, but I could not find one. Then I started a Chinese language course at the Government Technical Training Institute, Gulberg, Lahore. After completion of this short course, my interest in Chinese language increased.

'I continued my Chinese study for one and a half years and got a job. Nowadays, I'm teaching Chinese language at Tevta and earning 100,000 per month,' she said.

Iqra Asif, who has done master's degree in political science, said she took admission to a three-month Chinese language course at the Government Technical Training Institute, Gulberg, Lahore. On successful completion of the course, she got the job of a Chinese language teacher at a government institution.

Tevta Chairman Irfan Qaiser Sheikh said it was the right time to learn Chinese language to be part of the upcoming projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which would change economic conditions of the country and benefit technical hands of the country.

'As an industrial boom is expected after completion of the CPEC project, Tevta has started courses to train the youth for the future. Since work on CPEC projects has started, a major change is being seen in the education sector and students now prefer technical education to conventional education. Tevta is designing courses with focus on CPEC. Initiating Chinese language course is an example of this effort of Tevta,' he said.

The centre, located at the Northern Territory's Confucius institute - a partnership between CDU and the Anhui Normal and Hainan universities in China, will provide examinations in Mandarin.

Confucius institute Director Professor Martin Jarvis said the test centre would build on the strong relationships with teaching and learning institutions throughout China.

The manner our leaders will be discussing these issues is indeed in this kind of dialogue form."

The aim of the event is to promote cultural and social exchange between the young adults from China and South Africa.

In light of the topics discussed during the dialogue, Mr Song emphasized the importance of the relationship between China and South Africa. He said, "In April this year, Madam Liu Yandong, the Chinese Vice Premier visited South Africa to launch the China-South Africa High-Level People to people exchange Mechanism. This is the first of its kind between China and an African country. It will play an important role in bringing more benefits to our two peoples and build stronger support for China and South Africa."

The participants of the dialogue were selected through online applications. After two rounds of preliminary judgments, the top 10 students will receive an invitation to attend the final event; of which 2 came directly from China, 3 are Chinese students studying in South Africa, and 5 are local students.

Jul 31, 2017 (Tanzania Daily News/All Africa Global Media) -- Tanzania should embrace the culture of documenting and displaying important events in its museums to help the young generation learn and cherish their past.

Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Tanzania, Mr Guo Haodong, made the call in Dar es Salaam recently at a painting exhibition on the Tanzania Zambia Railway line (TAZARA): The long-sealed memory was hosted by the Confucius institute and the Department of Creative Art of the University of Dar es Salaam.

Mr Haodong observed that the TAZARA Railway reiterates the priceless legacy and heritage between Tanzania, Zambia and China.

"I have been to the museum in Tanzania and China, but none of them has something on TAZARA Railway, considering its remarkable history and the memory it holds between the people of the three countries," said Mr Haodong.

He stressed on the importance of merging the younger generation with the past for them to treasure the future. The railway line was previously known as the Uhuru Railway, but currently it's the railway for development and prosperity.

"There are plans to modernise the railway line, but we thought before transforming it we should unravel the long sealed memory for the current generation to know what had transpired," noted the Deputy Ambassador. He further pointed out that the plan is to host similar exhibitions on TAZARA in China and then Tanzania again by involving artists from both countries.

The Director of the Academy of Fine Arts, Zhejiang Normal University, Prof Qiu Xingxiong, noted that the exhibition involved eight artists from China. "To unveil the long-sealed memories, China's arts group used a short period of four days to tour and experience Tazara and made the sketches which are being displayed here today," said Prof Xingxiong.

Narrating the story of how TAZARA came to be, Prof Xingxiong said since 1965, China dispatched survey and design team to Tanzania and Zambia to carry out the whole line of reconnaissance. In December 1969, they completed the detailed survey report.

"In October, 1970, China sent more than 50,000 railway builders to construct the railway between Tanzania and Zambia. Enduring harsh environment and the threat of diseases, they finally finished the remarkable railway in six years, to build this railway, 65 Chinese experts sacrificed their precious lives," he noted.

On his part, the Head of the Department of Creative Arts, Dr Kedmon Mapana, was quick to note that arts are powerful in conveying messages.

"The education that people get through arts lasts forever in people's minds. The Chinese have posed a challenge, that even important matters such as that of the government, if demonstrated in the form of arts, can be understood easily by the people," noted Dr Mapana.

Benin students at the Confucius institute of the Abomey-Calavi University learned how to make traditional Chinese kites at a workshop here on Saturday.

At least 60 Benin students participated in the workshop. Guo Hongli, a kite specialist from China's kite city of Weifang in east China's Shandong Province, came to Benin to join the workshop and teach Benin children how to make a traditional Chinese kite which has been registered as a world intangible heritage since 2000.

Guo said he was very pleased to be in Cotonou to share with the children of Benin the fabrication techniques of kites so that they can make kites by themselves and fly kites during their spare time.

According to Guo, there are three phases of making a kite: first the framing, then the gathering of bamboo spare parts to constitute the outline of the kite, and finally the gluing and decoration of the kite.

Fifame Sehlin, a primary school girl at the Confucius institute, enjoyed learning how to make a kite.

"Following this workshop at the Chinese cultural center in Cotonou, I can now produce kite and show the fabrication process to my fellows," she said.

Frejus Kpogbozan, a first year student, said learning how to make a kite makes him know more about the Chinese culture and history.

Les imprimantes 3D ne sont pas vraiment une nouveauté.

En mars, par exemple, la Chine avait offert 23 imprimantes 3D, 12 scanners et 300 filaments d'impression au gouvernement mauricien, en vue de consolider les relations entre les deux pays. Cela, dans le cadre de l'ouverture du Confucius institute, à l'université de Maurice. Cette fois donc, ce sont les usines de textile, les étudiants et les start-up qui pourront en bénéficier. Rappelons que l'imprimante 3D permet de fabriquer des objets en relief, comme des jouets, par exemple. Il suffit de relier l'imprimante à l'ordinateur, d'envoyer un fichier qui contient le plan de fabrication.

Mais au lieu de mettre des cartouches d'encre, on y place du plastique ou du métal, entre autres matières. Celles-ci fondent et deviennent liquides.C'est à ce moment-là que l'imprimante 3D entre en action : elle fait couler la matière goutte à goutte, en suivant précisément le plan de fabrication qui a été envoyé. Le plastique, par exemple, s'empile en dessinant l'objet. Puis il se solidifie. Après quelques minutes, on obtient un objet en relief. D'où le nom d'imprimante 3D.

Extrait du Budget : &#x00AB;We are setting up two 3D Printing Service Centres at the National Computer Board to support manufacturing firms, university students and start-ups.

It is my great pleasure to attend the first anniversary celebration of Confucius institute at the University of Cape Coast. There is a Chinese saying, everything is hard in the beginning. In the past one year, teachers and volunteers of the Confucius institute at UCC have overcome a number of difficulties and given sweat of hardworking to get off to a flying start. I would like to express my deep respect for your unremitting efforts. I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude to the faculty members of UCC and our Ghanaian friends who are committed to China-Ghana friendship and who have rendered strong support to the smooth operation of Confucius institute.

Confucius institutes have traversed an extraordinary journey of 12 years. Up till now, there are 511 Confucius institutes and 1073 Confucius Classrooms in 140 countries with 2.1 million students of all kinds. Confucius institutes have become an important platform for exchange and mutual emulation of Chinese and other civilizations, and a window through which the world comes to know more about China and China deepens the friendship and cooperation with other countries.

Confucius institute at UCC is said to be the 500th Confucius institute around the world and the second in Ghana. Yet, I keep with myself letters requesting for setting up Confucius institute from vice-chancellors of several Ghanaian universities.

Perhaps it is time to answer one question, what is the reason that Confucius institutes are becoming increasingly popular and influential in this society?

First of all, it undoubtedly attributes to the charm of Chinese culture. Confucius institute is the place where people learn Chinese language and understand Chinese culture. The Chinese civilization traversed for thousands of years, and yielded large quantities of cultural treasures with broad and profound essence. There's a province called Shaanxi in China. The number of cultural relics displayed in the museums in this province reaches nearly 8 million. Today I brought here a birthday gift, called double-faced embroidery. This embroidery technology was developed a thousand years ago in China. You can see the splendor of Chinese culture through this piece of works. What's more, there are lots of ideas and moral norms originated from Chinese traditional culture, values of which never fade away. For example, the Chinese leaders often make full use of the sayings from our ancient wisdom and instruct the Chinese civil servants to acquire political ambitions such as Be the first to worry the woes of the people, and the last to share the weal of the people; to follow your heart of patriotism such as whatever my social status, I will never lay aside my concern for the nation, to obtain the awe-inspiring righteousness such as Never be corrupted by wealth and status, Never depart from principle due to poverty or humble position, Never bow down to power or coercion, and to have the spirit of dedication such as Everyone will one day die; when my day comes, may my loyalty to the country be inscribed into history. The Chinese nation has developed the human-oriented concept of loving all creatures as if they are your kind and all people as if they are your brothers, the political concept of governing with both virtue and rule of law, the peaceful approach of love, non-offense and good-neighborliness, the idea of peace being of paramount importance and harmony without uniformity as well as personal conduct to treat others in a way that you would like to be treated and help others succeed if you want to succeed yourself. These traditional values with a unique oriental touch provide endless source of invaluable cultural assets to the theory and practice of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.

Second, it attributes to the comprehensive national strength of China. The increasing influence of Chinese culture is indispensable with China's rapid economic development. As Chairman Mao Zedong's poem goes, Nanjing City, getting rid of the old ruler, outshines its ancient glories; in heroic triumph heaven and earth have been overturned. After reform and opening-up for over 30 years, China has become the second largest economy in the world and the main driving force for the world economy, contributing 30% annually to the world economy. China is leading global governance by contributing Chinese wisdom and Chinese proposals. The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was concluded in Beijing half a month ago with abundant results. Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out in his remarks that China will insist on jointly building through consultation to meet the interests of all, aiming at policy, infrastructure, trade, finance and people-to-people connectivity. China will work together with other countries to build the Belt and Road into a road of peace, prosperity, opening up, innovation, and civilization. This caused active response from all parties. China signed dozens of cooperation agreements with countries and international organizations during the Forum, which outlined the road map for the success of the Belt and Road Initiative and pointed a clear way for future cooperation. China brought up many new measures to build synergies in development strategies and policies, promote the construction of economic corridor, enhance major projects cooperation and enlarge financial support. This shows China's responsibility. This sends out the strongest voice of the times.

Third, it attributes to the vigor of China-Ghana relations. Ghana is the second sub-Saharan African country to establish diplomatic relations with China. After 56 years, our relations have grown from strength to strength and our cooperation in all areas has obtained significant success, bringing real benefits to our two peoples. Ghana is an important partner to China on the African continent.

He said that the Confucius institute Headquarters has made consistent efforts to promote the China-Africa friendship, and the rapid developing Confucius institutes in Africa has become an important vehicle of cultural exchanges between China and Africa. He highly appreciated the immense support rendered by the Zambian side to the Confucius institute for teaching Chinese and promoting Chinese culture. He then made three suggestions on further promoting the development of Confucius institutes in Africa: Firstly, to cater for the actual learning demands of the people in different countries, not only emphasizing the general character, but also taking into consideration of the unique conditions of each country, and providing the educational contents which can be easily appreciated by the local people. Secondly, to give full play to the comparative advantage of China and Africa, so as to promote both the Chinese and African culture, and enhance cultural exchanges and common development. Thirdly, to enhance the practicability and pertinence of the Chinese language teaching, integrate closely with China-Africa practical cooperation, and raise the ability of the local people in opening businesses and getting jobs. Ambassador Yang said the Chinese Embassy in Zambia is committed to encourage the development of the Confucius institute, promote a better understanding of the people of Zambia and other countries about China, and deepen the friendship and cooperation between China and Africa.

Hon. Dr. Dennis Wanchinga, Minister of General Education of Zambia in his remarks expressed his pleasure for the rapid development of the Confucius institutes in Africa and affirmed the important role played by the Confucius institutes in promoting mutual understanding and friendship between Africa and China. He said that China is an all-weather friend of Zambia and the whole Africa. In recent years, China-Africa cooperation has opened a new chapter, with many achievements from cooperation in various fields between China and Zambia. He said the Zambian Government is committed to keep promoting the consistent and healthy development of China-Zambia relations. The Zambian side attaches great importance to the educational and cultural exchanges and cooperation with China and is hopeful to make joint efforts with China in developing the Confucius institute into an important platform for deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Africa.

Mr. Xia Jianhui in his remarks spoke highly of the achievements of the African Confucius institutes in recent years. He said although the numbers of Confucius institutes in Africa are few, they perform the best in the world. He expressed his hope that both Chinese and African sides will maintain the good momentune of cooperation, continue to improve the education quality of the Confucius institutes constantly, expand the Chinese teaching and promote Chinese culture, and make greater contribution to the development of China-Africa friendship under the Belt and Road Initiative.

Prof. Wu Yiqing said, as the partner Chinese University, the Hebei University of Economics and Business would like to further strengthen its the exchanges and cooperation with UNZA through the Confucius institute, and further promote the people-to-people exchanges.

The Conference lasted two days, and the participants held in-depth exchanges around on the topics including local teacher training, vocational and technical training, cooperation between Confucius institutes and Chinese companies.

May 11, 2017 (The Herald/All Africa Global Media) -- Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Huang Ping has rubbished assertions that China wants to colonise Africa. Speaking on the sidelines of a public lecture at the University of Zimbabwe, Mr Huang said China was committed to the principles of sincerity and goodwill. The lecture was titled: "China's Development and China's Relations with Africa and Zimbabwe" and was attended by mostly students from the Confucius institute at the University of Zimbabwe.

"China did not come to colonise anyone, we cherish the way of cooperation, of peace and development," said Mr Huang.

Mr Huang outlined progress being made in the implementation of the mega deals signed between Zimbabwe and China two years ago.

He said the Kariba South Hydro Power Station will be completed in the first quarter of next year, with one of the two generators put on the national grid by the end of this year.

The power station is being constructed by Chinese firm Sino Hydro, with financial support from the China Eximbank.

Mr Huang said Chinese constructors were waiting for the Zimbabwean Government to construct a link road and other amenities before moving on site to build the new Parliament Building in Mt Hampden.

The financial negotiations for the expansion of the Hwange Thermal Power Station were being concluded, he said.

Plans for the pharmaceutical warehouse to be built by the Chinese were being drafted by Chinese architects and the Ministry of Health and Child Care.

Mr Huang said other deals being implemented were at varying stages, while China had provided finances for numerous projects in Zimbabwe.

Commenting on reports that Chinese business people were abusing employees in Zimbabwe, Ambassador Huang said they always taught their people to respect the laws of the country.

"We teach our people to live harmoniously with the local people and shoulder responsibility as part of this community, but I cannot guarantee that everyone is a good guy," he said.

"If someone is committing crimes against your laws and regulations here, then arrest them."

UZ's Pro-Vice Chancellor Academic Affairs Professor Pedzisai Mashiri dismissed propaganda circulating to the effect that China wanted to colonise Africa.

"It is a foolish argument," he said. "It is a colonial imperialist argument because Africa has remained as one of the virgin land in the world in terms of natural resources" he said

"Europe and America are competing for resources with China, so there is a fierce competition and obviously the presence of China in Africa threatens the interests of Europe and America.

"When you hear the West talking about China colonising Africa, they are simply trying to create propaganda in order to brainwash Africans to fight and resist Chinese involvement in Africa."

Prof Mashiri said history recorded that the Chinese were on the African shores long before the coming of the Europeans.

China and the US are important players in the politics and economic development of Africa. These two major powers have undertaken several initiatives to deepen their engagement with the continent to expand their interests.

Despite President Donald Trump's attempt to reverse the US's global leadership through his anti-globalisation and a foreign policy of isolationism, Washington remains an important player in Africa.

Historically, the US has had a head start on investment and commercial engagement with Africa, its focus has mostly been on promoting liberal democratic ideals for economic development. China, on the other hand, has enhanced its role on the continent with a no-strings attached approach to investment and commercial engagement, creating the impression that Beijing is ready and willing to support Africa's development efforts.

Africa is a strategic region for the US and China, and this should propel the AU to use this opportunity to further its development agenda for the continent. It should not be Beijing or Washington that shapes Africa's agenda; rather Africa must define how it could strategically engage these global giants. In other words, Africa should stand firm and negotiate fair deals (win-win) with China and the US. The AU has gradually developed a clear strategic framework that guides its relationship with external actors.

The University of Johannesburg Confucius institute (UJCI), in partnership with the UJ Library, hosted a successful public dialogue on The role of China and the US in Africa's Quest for Development. The key areas of the public dialogue were: The role of the African Agency in shaping the outcomes of its engagements with external partners, Africa's developmental agenda (as defined by the AU's Agenda 2063), A critical evaluation of whether the US and China are competitors or partners in their interactions with the African continent.

Although the African continent is undoubtedly endowed with rich mineral resources, from north through the west and south, its youthful population remains the greatest asset in its possession.

It has always been these minerals and the African people that external powers have exploited to power their own development.

There are also new oil and gas discoveries in East Africa. From Central to southern Africa minerals such as coltan, gold, diamonds, tin, uranium are found. For example, literature estimates that the DRC contains about $24 trillion (R299 trillion) dollars' worth of valuable minerals.

These minerals are equivalent to the combined GDP's of Europe and the US. Yet Africa remains the most under-developed region in the world.

Access to Africa's natural resources is a central point of friction between China and the US. It seems as if China and the US are using development to capture Africa's attention.

Three questions can be asked (i) are China and the US bringing about development in Africa. (ii) Are China and the US using development as an entry point to access Africa's natural resources and (iii) Are China and the US partners or enemies in Africa's quest for development?

Historically, Africa has been a battleground for great powers such as the East versus the West (US and USSR, now Russia). During the Cold War, Africa gained nothing. Instead, in the Cold War aftermath, Africa was engulfed by intractable conflicts which deepened poverty and marginalised Africa further.

This means that the presence of China and the US in Africa - for the purpose of bringing about the development and access to Africa's natural resources - is likely to lead to a conflict of interest between the two economic superpowers, an issue that might leave Africa hopeless. The question that comes to mind is whether China and the US are becoming enemies or partners in Africa.

As a matter of fact, with the rise of China and its economic interests firmly squared on African resources, the West and particularly the US has become fearful of China's in-roads. For example, the Chinese have made significant investments in infrastructure projects in Africa. This has made Africa a high priority in China's agenda through the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). In 2015, at the FOCAC summit in South Africa, the Chinese President Xi Jinping promised $60 billion in developmental assistance to Africa.

African leaders perceived this pledge as win-win co-operation, with a huge portion of the funds earmarked for projects in infrastructure, healthcare, human resource, ICT, agriculture, special trade and economic zones as well as the cancellation of outstanding debts for least developed countries.

Assuredly, China has incorporated Africa in its most ambitious project to date, the One Belt One Road and the 21st Century Maritime Route (OBOR) Initiative, to further strengthen the historical bonds between the two sides. China nominated Kenya to be Africa's hub for its OBOR initiative due to its geo-strategic position. It is currently investing heavily in rail infrastructure projects linking Kenya and its landlocked neighbours including Uganda, South Sudan, Burundi and Rwanda. Literature estimates that such investments will unlock intra-Africa as well as broader international trade opportunities in the process.

In parallel with this, Tanzania and the Export-Import Bank of China inked a $7.6bn loan agreement for the construction of a standard gauge railway corridor project that will also link Tanzania with regional neighbours Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Congo.

The Chinese no-strings attached approach to development in Africa has been "resource for development".

The AU ought to engage the Trump administration on a broad range of issues affecting the continent.

The most critical issues are: saving the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, limiting the impact of Trump's budget cuts to the UN, and to ensure that Africa is not negatively affected by what appears to be an anti-Muslim campaign advanced by his administration.

Africa should be very eager to use this opportunity to further its development.

It should not be Beijing or Washington that shape Africa's agenda, rather Africa must define how to strategically engage these two powers.

Africa should play an active role to avoid it becoming a battleground as was the case during the Cold War in what appears as an emerging economic cold war.

Therefore, Africa should stand firm and negotiate fair deals (win-win) with China and the US.

He informed that number of students have already got job opportunities on the basis of Chinese Language. He said that the wonderful results and encouraging response has made PCJCCI more determined in its goal to foster Pak-China relations within the all cultural, social and regional dimensions.

The student's response concerning the services of PCJCCI in regards of Chinese language was very affirmative. According to them, PCJCCI initiated Chinese language teaching system at a time when there was very little awareness among people about the significance of learning Chinese language, and now thousands of people have benefitted from this initiative, that is no doubt a worth mentioning fact.

HENG WANG, who is known at Durban University of Technology (DUT) by her English and Zulu names, Doris or Mbalenhle, could never have imagined dance would bring her to South Africa.

Yet, her passion for ballet and Chinese folk dancing has enabled her to take on a critical role in bridging understanding between Durban's youth and their contemporaries in China.

Wang is part of the Confucius institute at DUT and in the 18 months she has been in South Africa she has discovered that while language barriers are real, dance is universal.

Her students are a mixed group - some from neighbouring countries - but all fascinated by China and its cultural heritage.

Wang originates from Jilin province in the north-east of China bordering North Korea and Russia. She first came to South Africa in 2014 as a member of a dance group from Fujian Agriculture Forestry University (Fafu). They performed Chinese folk dance for audiences at the Universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch and DUT.

"After those performances, I saw that South Africa was much better than I had ever imagined. At that time I had never thought of working here, because I was planning to get a job and do my Master's in mathematics in China."

But her situation changed when she didn't make it into the maths Master's programme. An instructor from the foreign affairs office at Fafu asked her if she would be keen to return to South Africa, this time to teach Mandarin and Chinese folk dancing.

From early childhood, her parents had ensured that she attended a host of extra classes including piano, dance, Olympiad mathematics and Olympiad physics. Her favourite were always the dance classes, which she started when she was just three years old.

Wang wanted to be a professional dancer but her parents wouldn't allow it because they wanted her to be an academic. It was common in China for parents to choose a career stream for their child, she said.

"After many disputes, last year my parents finally recognised that dance was not only a dream but my passion. However, their wish is still that I finish a doctoral degree," she said.

She danced ballet from childhood but, when she injured a leg, her doctor said she should refrain from strenuous movements so the passionate ballerina switched to folk, classic and modern dance which interfered less with her injury.

Rehearsing is never a problem for Wang who says it gives her more time to polish her moves. She does not mind rehearsing for a whole day when she has time. "The longest piece I did was 10 minutes and 20 seconds, it was exhausting and we rehearsed every day for three months," she said.

During a Chinese dance performance, the performers wear colourful costumes which typically represent their ethnic group depending on the type of dance.

"China has 55 ethnic groups and each has its specific colours," she said.

Wang's dance classes at DUT have seen one of her students, Geraldine Dzinoreva, also join the group learning Mandarin. She is so proud of Dzinoreva because she went to China for a one-month exchange programme especially prepared for dancers.

She perceives her as a student with a promising future in Chinese dance. "I think her life may change because of Chinese dance, which she is passionate about," said Wang.

Wang is planning to do a dance show at DUT this year. Her goal is to teach students the five core Chinese folk dances. She believes that she has talented students who work wonders in Chinese dance. Her only concern is they don't have enough time for rehearsals because most students have classes during the day.

She says she loves dancing because it makes her feel she is in another world.

"I put all my emotions into the dance. When I am happy I want to dance and, when I am sad, I want to dance. I don't need to dance to music since I can dance without it; I dance to express my feelings and tell a story."

The equipment was handed over by the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China, Mr Li Li to the Prime Minister, Mr Pravind Kumar Jugnauth yesterday afternoon at the New Treasury Building in Port Louis.

In his address, Prime Minister Jugnauth expressed his gratitude towards the Chinese Authority for demonstrating its continuous unflinching support to the development of Mauritius. According to him, this donation of equipment which will be used for information and communication technology purposes in various departments, is yet another leap forward towards reinforcing the relationship between the two countries. This gesture, he said bears testimony to the longstanding relationship between Mauritius and China since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1972 and must be nurtured, he added.

The Prime Minister pointed out the strong bilateral and economic cooperation that exist between the two countries while highlighting that Mauritius has always been privileged by China in terms of expertise, funding and technical assistance for the implementation of several projects. They are namely, the donation of semi-low floor buses; the Bagatelle Dam project; the new Terminal at the SSRI airport; and the construction of a multi-purpose Olympic sports complex among others.

For his part, Ambassador Li Li spoke of the friendly and long-lasting relationship between China and Mauritius which has strengthened with time. He further outlined that the donation of equipment fits in the determination of the Chinese Authority to help Mauritius in its developmental phase. Moreover, he reiterated China's resolve to continue to provide assistance to Mauritius in various spheres.

THE Chinese Ambassador to South Africa, Tian Xuejun, yesterday applauded his country's embassy, the Gauteng Department of Education and other stakeholders involved in taking the Chinese education curriculum to the next level.

The embassy had just given smart boards and Chinese books to 10 city schools that participated in the Chinese language pilot programme offered by the Confucius institute, which has been liaising with various schools on the implementation of the Mandarin learning programme.

Positive interactions between China and South Africa were also cited as a reason for the donation of the innovative equipment.

The Confucius institute is a non-profit public educational organisation affiliated with the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. It promotes Chinese language and culture.

The handover ceremony was held at Willowridge High School and was attended by Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga and the headmasters of all the schools.

"In March 2015, the minister, on behalf of the South African government, announced a decision to incorporate the Chinese language into the country's national teaching curriculum. "Since then Chinese language learning has become another important bridge of friendship and co-operation between China and South Africa," said Xuejun.

He said after South Africa they would work on strengthening relations with Mauritius, Tanzania, Cameroon and Zambia, who had all incorporated Chinese language teaching in their national education curriculum.

That had resulted to the Chinese language education increasingly being popularised across the African continent.

Xuejun said they had joined the efforts of the Department of Basic Education by inviting experts from China among other things, to help develop the quality of teaching Chinese language.

"We brought from China, experienced teachers and volunteers and 2000 sets of textbooks and education equipment to support the teaching programmes across the pilot schools.

"We can never underestimate the significance of our efforts in assisting the department of basic education on the training of South Africa's own Chinese language teachers," said Xuejun.

He said that he only hoped that the programme would expand into something bigger and better to benefit South Africa and China in an increasingly positive way.

"As these programmes expand, we would only strengthen our support to your efforts. We will send more teachers and volunteers to help train more local teachers, while they compile Chinese language text books tailored for South African students," said Xuejun.

Motshekga acknowledged the efforts and said it was a job well done by the embassy, which had a vibrant partnership with China.

"China is one of the most vibrant partnerships we have as a sector. South Africa and China are strategic partners in many aspects and education is a fundamental and integral part of the broader relations between us," said Motshekga.

She added that she valued the education system in China, which was working closely with the country in sharing ideas of how best they could improve the education system in South Africa.

"As a minister I have had many opportunities to visit China and appreciate their education system.

"It's been two years since we hosted the Maths Olympiad wherein China was number one. Even the candidates that got to position two and three were also Chinese.

"That can only be a pointer that the Chinese people blossomed everywhere in the continent," said Motshekga.

She said the donation of equipment was not only about the exchanging of gifts, but sharing experiences about how to do the best for the children as they were an asset to the country.

"The safest way we can prepare them for this revolution is to ensure that we strengthen them both intellectually and emotionally so that they can confront any new experience that comes their way," said Motshekga.

School choirs sang at the ceremony and South African pupils presented paintings in Mandarin and also made speeches in the Chinese language.

Chinese calligraphists Zhu Pinfang and Zhao Li arrived in India for the first time on December 20, 2016 for a mission in Solapur, a small textile city in southern Maharashtra.Both experts toiled relentlessly for 18 days to restore a 75-year-old condolence message written on December 29, 1942 by chairman Mao Zedong to the family of Dwarkanath Kotnis, who was born in Solapur.The restored letter will be handed over on Tuesday to Solapur's civic officials at a ceremony at Confucius institute in Mumbai University. Kotnis was among the five-member medical team that went to China in 1939 in response to a call seeking medical assistance during the second Sino-Japanese War.He worked tirelessly in China for four years, before he passed away at the young age of 32. Touched by Kotnis's work in China, Mao, a master calligraphist himself, penned a moving tribute and condolence message to his family in Solapur.The 3-foot-long letter was written on traditional rice paper using charcoal black ink.

Cairo, Jan 03, 2017 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media) -- Cairo University's Confucius institute no longer targets only university students of Chinese language, but it started to attract students from different faculties and will soon open branches in more universities and schools nationwide in Egypt, the institute manager told Xinhua in an interview Tuesday.

"Over the past two years, we started to receive students of irrelevant faculties such as engineering, antiquities, science, law and commerce, besides tour guides who would like to learn Chinese language for career development," said Professor Rehab Mahmoud, manager of Confucius institute and head of Chinese Language Department at Cairo University.

The professor explained that Confucius institute has opened branches in many places outside Cairo University, including Pharos University in Alexandria province, Benha University in Qalyoubiya province and Fayoum University in Fayoum province, besides other branches in several high, preparatory and elementary schools across the country.

"From the next semester, we will open a branch in Misr University for Science and Technology in Cairo and another in Aswan University in Upper Egypt's Aswan province," Professor Mahmoud told Xinhua, noting the institute hosts in 2016 about 1,200 students besides some 600 students in its various branches.

Becoming a bridge for Egyptian-Chinese cultural interaction, Confucius institute was founded in Cairo University in 2007 as per an agreement with Peking University, and the institute is scheduled to hold a ceremony to mark its 10th anniversary in 2017.

"To be honest, Confucius institute is so much cared for by Cairo University, Peking University as well as the Chinese embassy in Cairo and they all swiftly respond to resolve any obstacles facing the institute," said the institute chief.

Mahmoud added that Chinese companies in Egypt ask Confucius institute to recommend Egyptian Chinese-speaking employees for them. "We have recently recommended some for Chinese contractors working in the construction of Egypt's new administrative capital city."

Earlier in December, the institute in Cairo was awarded as a "Model Confucius institute" during the 11th Confucius institute Conference held in Kunming city of southwest Yunnan Province in China and attended by some 2,200 representatives from 140 countries and regions.

"We are so proud of the award. It was really the result of massive efforts as we held a lot of activities to mark 2016 as the Egyptian-Chinese Cultural Year," she said.

The professor, also awarded as one of the best Confucius institute managers last year, said that the institute was also selected by Hanban, Confucius institute Headquarters in Beijing, to be the development center for Chinese-teaching professors in the Arab region.

As for cooperation with Peking University, Professor Mahmoud illustrated that Cairo University has recently held a high-level forum in cooperation with Peking University that was attended by 26 professors and its second version will soon be held in Cairo University in 2017.

"We also held many activities attended by Chinese professors from various universities including week-long forums on Chinese sports, music, arts, etc, during which a music band from Peking University staged performances in the Opera House and Cairo University," the professor told Xinhua.

Egyptian higher education top officials refer to China's educational experience as inspiring and the exchanging academic visits and cooperation with Chinese universities as necessary interaction for both countries that enjoy growing bilateral relations.

"Among the key events joined by Confucius institute was Egypt-China University Presidents Forum held in Cairo University in March and was attended by Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong," said the Confucius institute manager, noting the institute had at least six cultural activities per month throughout 2016.

 Chancellor, Prof Idrisa Kikula, has encouraged secondary school students in the country to learn Chinese in their studies because the language will assure them with a brighter of technology.

Prof Kikula was giving an opening speech at the event for 2nd Chinese Bridge Proficiency competition prepared by Confucius institute at the University of Dodoma during the week in Dodoma.

Prof Kikula noted that language is among factors that connect the world with development and the Chinese Language is now a key instrument to utilise opportunities found in the Republic of China, including education scholarship, trade and tourism.

China has proved to be powerful in all aspects of innovation and technological application in various sectors. It, however, needed to strengthen its relationship with other foreign countries for trade, said the professor.

He further stressed that the Chinese language was a bridge to connect other foreign people with the Republic of China. For young Tanzanian students it was the best opportunity to utilise it.

Prof Kikula illustrated his message by citing trade opportunities available in China, saying many businessmen failed to make proper agreement or contract with Chinese firms because of the language barrier.

He therefore urged all students to learn the language properly.

Meanwhile, cultural counselor from Chinese Embassy in the country Mr Gao Wei told Tanzanian students not to ignore chances given by the Republic of China particularly the role played by Confucius institute.

Such opportunities, he said, was the best alternative to enjoy plenty of scholarship chances in China. The counselor said China looked forward to more and wider trade opportunities with foreigners especially in the technology and tourism area.

Tanzanians should not hesitate to get involved, he added. The Chinese Bridge competition is a very common event held by Confucius institute worldwide. It tests Chinese talents in foreign students. It is the second time it is held in the country.

The competition that involved nine secondary schools from Dodoma, Morogoro, Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar aimed to get the best two winners to represent the country in the world Chinese Bridge competition that will be held in Beijing China next October.

Two students won the award. The first one, Daudi Tamimu from Dodoma Secondary of Dodoma Municipal, emerged the first winner. The other one was Lyay Alli from Lord Baden Secondary School of Dar es Salaam.

The competition was divided into three major parts in which the contesters were subjected to a three-minute presentation of a speech in the Chinese language. They also read and sang in Chinese as they danced.

Aug 25, 2016 (The Guardian/All Africa Global Media) -- Director, Confucius institute, University of Lagos, Prof. Yongjing Wang, says Nigerians who develop interest and competency in learning Chinese language, are better positioned to get scholarships offered by Confucius institute Headquarters (HANBAN), China, and an opportunity to find good jobs in Chinese enterprises.

According to her, such competency in the language, creates a platform to choose from hundreds of universities in China to receive higher education from.

Speaking in an interview with The Guardian, Wang said; "There are all kinds of officially organised visits to China every year. So, anybody who is learning, or has learnt Chinese language can apply to go," adding that there has been a rising interest learning the language among Nigerians, in recent times by Nigerians.

"Everyday people in different fields, including parents of young children as young as 6-year-olds come to my office, or the reception of Confucius institute for inquiry, or to register for the learning of Chinese in Confucius institute, especially after May, when we had the Chinese Bridge Competition, and June, when we had Chinese Culture Month events. More people are interested in learning Chinese."

She added: "There are more and more Chinese business men coming to Lagos after the visit of President Buhari to China. Nigerian governments and that of China are doing more in many fields, which can encourage more communication between people of the two countries.

"There are two Confucius institutes in Nigeria, so the students sent to China could be up to 50 in the last two years based on their HSK competency results. HSK fee is N1,000 to N4000 per head for different levels; and we are organising technical training for Nigerians who are eager to learn techniques in agriculture, Chinese cooking, car and phone repairs amongst others," she explained.

The debate on the deteriorating quality of education in Botswana took a new turn last week when academics condemned the proliferation of many private "universities", which currently stand at seven serving a population of approximately two million people, and called for their closure. Different speakers at a BOT50 Public Lecture Series under the topic "Capturing Botswana's Major Milestones" at the University of Botswana (UB) Centre for Continuing Education last week said the new "universities" are duplicating programmes offered at already existing government tertiary institutions while the quality of some courses they offer is suspect. The public lecture was organised to capture the country's major milestones since independence such as the introduction of the local currency, national railways and airline, the discovery of diamonds and its first university.

A discussant on the subject, Professor Part Mgadla from the University of Botswana Confucius institute said if he had the powers he would close those universities that provide already existing programmes. He said having seven universities, all in Gaborone is too much, and leads to duplication of programmes which in some institutions are accredited by universities outside the country. This creates a problem of monitoring the quality of the programmes, he said. Former PPADB boss Armando Lionjanga had asked the panellists to comment on the proliferation of private universities in a small population of just about two million people, and the implications on the quality of graduates. Deputy Vice Chancellor (Student Affairs) Professor Martin Mokgwathi dedictated part of his vote of thanks speech to extol the academic superiority of UB, as the best the country can offer. He cautioned that academic excellence at the institution should not be "vocationalised" in an attempt to cast aspersion on their integrity and questioning the quality of their graduates. "We are proud of who we are. Some of us have lived all our lives here as students and later teaching in the same institution. Therefore there is no doubt that we are the best in this country," he said.

Giving a public lecture on some of Botswana's major milestones from the time the country gained independence fifty years ago former Minister of Education (1994 to 1999), Dr Gaositwe Chiepe, expressed hope that the numerous national and private universities which have mushroomed in the country will complement and cooperate among themselves. Last week the Ministry of Education and Skills Development (MoESD) released a statement criticising some universities, among them the UB for failing to advise potential students about courses which do not attract sponsorship from government. It also emerged in the statement that UB has failed to attract enough students for the 2016/17 academic year. UB was established and granted land to develop into a mighty university after Botswana's founding President the late Sir Seretse Khama called on the nation to practice self-help. With the war cry of one man one beast Botswana University Campus Appeal (BUCA) was launched, attracting staggering donations of cattle, goats, sheep, chickens, bags of maize or beans, money.

The CI Director, Prof Xiazhen Zhang, said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the three weeks camp is aimed at giving a chance to the students to learn Chinese language, culture and history, saying the CI will cover the costs of international airfare, accommodation, food and transportation in China.

"The Chinese Summer Camp programme will cover comprehensive Chinese, Chinese listening and speaking, Chinese calligraphy and Chinese Kungfu," said the CI Director at the pre-departure ceremony.

"This will increase mutual understanding among the people of China and Tanzania," she observed.

"Our country is endowed with a good number of tourist attractions. You should therefore make use of the opportunity to promote various tourist attractions in the country," he said. Mr Saul Bichwa, who is the team leader of the students, said the trip will help them expand the scope of exposure, promising that they would be good ambassadors of the country.

 Local Director of the Confucius institute at Fourah Bay College, Kenneth Osho, has disclosed that 20 students of the institute would visit China in December this year.

He made this disclosure during the celebration of Language Studies Week (Chinese Day) last Thursday at the Mary Kingsley Auditorium, on FBC campus, themed "Language: the way to breaking barriers."

Mr Osho said the Confucius institute started in March 2012, but was officially launched in September 2012, adding that from just two tutors the institute now has five.

"The Institute also has five teaching places which include FBC, IPAM, one private secondary school, Lumley fishing community. Since the establishment of the Confucius institute, we have trained 4,000 students Chinese learners," he said.

He disclosed that the Institute had given scholarship to 18 students who are pursuing post-graduate studies in China, adding that currently eight students are in China pursuing courses in Chinese, with another six due to travel this September.

He said over 60 members of government institutions and students have visited China in recent times.

"I have just received the results of those Sierra Leoneans who are studying in China. The results are very good and I was told that they are having a resounding success in the pursuance of their courses in China," he told the gathering of students, faculty members, guest and journalists.

He explained that six new courses have been introduced into the curriculum at the University of Sierra Leone this year, but the Chinese language is not among. He said he had optimism that by 2017 students should have begun majoring in Chinese but that was scuppered by the outbreak of Ebola. "By 2018, we are hoping to start doing Chinese language as a course and students will have to graduate with B.A. major in Chinese Language," he declared.

He said he is doing a proposal that would enable the Confucius institute to be independent of the Language Studies Department.

Speaking at the event, Director of Middle East and Asia in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Mohamed S. Conteh described the relationship between Sierra Leone and China as "fruitful."

He said China had been the most responsive and steadfast partner to Sierra Leone and that that was evident during the Ebola outbreak when the Chinese were the first to come to the aid of Sierra Leone. He added that the Chinese have been supporting the country in the areas of agriculture, education, fisheries, sport, infrastructure, electricity, among others.

The outgone President of the Chinese Language Society (CLASO), Jane E.T. Conteh, said some students of Fourah Bay College, through help from the Confucius institute, have been able to break the language barrier and can now speak the Chinese language fluently.

"Most of our colleagues have been gainfully employed as Chinese interpreters. We have broken the chain between cultures as we can now do many things in Chinese," she said.

Meanwhile, poems and drama performances in mandarin Chinese climaxed the event.

It all seemed like a dream for Hanna Hipangelwa, a Namibian student, when she flew to Beijing for an exciting summer camp.

In China, she spent 15 days at the China University of Geosciences, Beijing (CUGB), which was the hosting university that provided summer campers from Namibia with various events in terms of language learning and culture exploration.

Hanna, a grade 11 from Emmanuel Shafidi, a secondary school situated in the heart of Katutura, a township of capital Windhoek, had never been outside the borders of the country, let alone the continent.

"I'm still dreaming right now. I had never been on a plane before, let alone go to a country where I got exposed to in-depth Chinese language and culture, with the people, who grew up and still live there," she said in an interview with Xinhua.

Hanna was one of the many students from Namibia who had excelled at the Confucius institute at her secondary school.

Through her perseverance and interest in Chinese culture and language, she managed to qualify for the Confucius institute Summer Camp for Secondary Students.

Ever since the first setting up of Chinese Teaching Site in one secondary school, there are now five Chinese Teaching Sites in five secondary schools now and registered learners are more than 120.

"I can safely say that I polished on my mandarin and can testify that China has the most understanding people and best food ever," she said.

Like Hanna, another Student, from Emmanuel Shifidi Secondary School, could not wait to reveal how the summer camp was for him.

"Since the camp, I have been able to speak and express my self more in mandarin since we were offered 30 hours of language learning which specified in several topics matching with the theme of culture exploration. I learnt more language phrases and improved my language a notch," he said.

In other interviews with students from a different school, A. Shipena Secondary also located in Katutura, Lucia Hikarare, a grade 12 learner said, "What I learned during the two weeks was amazing."

"I learned how to do Chinese paint, which is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world, painting in the traditional style," she said.

The students also managed to do calligraphy, the visual art related to writing, which they executed with a broad tip instrument.

Unlike the other students, two brothers, Saad Ndatipo and Simson Ndatipo, managed to capture China in it's true form as a majestic country in terms of the environment and sceneries.

"The place was so green and Beijing is a very clean place. We thought we would come across a crowded city, but to our surprise it was a different experience all together," they said.

"China should not be underestimated as it is very advanced, and hope one day I will be able to further my education in this country. The museums are great and we learned more tones in mandarin and now we can safely speak more fluently," Saad said.

Furthermore, Simson said, when he had enrolled for the Chinese classes in Namibia, he wanted to learn more about the Chinese Culture and language and the summer camp did more than that. Now he can proudly say he is surely mastering the culture and language.

Campers also visited Hanban, the Headquarters of Confucius institute, where they were introduced Chinese drama and development of Chinese characters with the aid of modern technology. The most exciting events for all the students was visiting of the Great Wall, Tian Anmen Square, Forbidden City, Bird Nest Stadium and Water Cube Stadium.

Most of the student who went on the summer camp said they aspire to do different courses at the Universities in China and hope after they finish with their secondary education, they would like to go to their many institutions to learn so that they can use what they would have learned to make Namibia better.

Currently in Namibia, the Chinese Language is not under curriculum of local secondary school as an examined subject, but the number of learners is increasing rapidly and more schools indicate their willingness of setting up Chinese Teaching Sites.

Windhoek, May 19, 2016 (New Era/All Africa Global Media) -- As China continues to invest and make its presence felt in Africa more and more Namibians are showing an interest in learning the Chinese language. This is according to two Chinese volunteer teachers of the Chinese language at the Confucius institute at the University of Namibia.

"We have more than 100 students who are learning Chinese. More Chinese are coming to Namibia for business and so in return the students are interested to learn about the Chinese culture, language and way of life," said Ellen Wang Yixuan, who teaches at the Rundu and Hifikepunye Pohamba campuses.

She says with the Chinese investing heavily in Africa, including Namibia, communication is very important for mutual understanding. "Students are eager to learn Chinese, because they are eager to contribute to the mutual friendship between Namibia and China," Yixuan explained.

Chen Nan, also a volunteer teacher of the Chinese language, added that the Chinese economy has a major influence on Africa and China is interested in penetrating the African market, hence the reciprocal interest by Namibians in learning the language. "Most students are good at pronouncing the words in Chinese," Nan enthused.

However, many of them struggle with mastering the characters, because the characters are very different from what they are used to," she further explained.

"Besides teaching Chinese we encourage the students to travel to China, and we offer scholarships and various other programmes that help the students to easily master the language," Yixuan said.

The Confucius institute was established in 2013 and more than 700 students at Unam, as well as those who are not registered university students had the opportunity to register at the institute in order to learn the Chinese language.

This is after emerging winners of the 15th Chinese-Bridge Proficiency Competition held recently at the Embassy of People's Republic of China in Windhoek. The competition by the Chinese Embassy in Namibia in collaboration with the Confucius institute (CI) at the University of Namibia (UNAM) was hosted for foreign college students under the theme: 'Dreams enlighten the future'.

Ten Unam students from different campuses participated in the competition. They were required to demonstrate their language proficiency in Chinese by answering quizzes and also singing, playing an instrument or dancing to show their understanding of Chinese culture.

Siegfried Klepach, the first winner of the competition, said practicing was not easy. He used to go through his script every day with assistance from his lecturer. "It was a new experience. It is difficult to pronounce so I repeated the song I sang and the script I presented over and over," he said.

Klepach added that learning a new language is an advantage, saying he enjoyed the competition and those that did not win must not feel like they lost because they all had learned a lot from preparing their presentations. "It is an experience I would repeat over and over again," said Klepach.

Second winner Simbarashe Chitenderu said he used to read his speech every day and tried to recite it so that he could get comfortable with the words and the pauses between entences. He also got a lot of encouragement from family and friends who helped him rehearse.

"I tried to listen and sing along with the song to get used to it," said Chitenderu.

"We spoke, performed and answered questions in Mandarin, a difficult language in a competition. All this in front of an audience and that alone should be something tobe proud of. We should continue to learn the language, as it will be a major asset in the future," noted Chitenderu.

Another winner Christator Musamadya, who took 3rd prize, said she used to spend about four to six hours every week with her lecturer to prepare for the competition. "I would record my self singing and saying the speech, so I could hear how it was to listen to me and would correct myself where I had some wrong pronunciation," she said.

One of the participants that did not win, Marigaleta Matheus, said although she did not win taking part in the competition was a valuable experience that she will never forget. "It's not a loss, after all we are learning a language that is something itself. Not winning is not the end of the world. Life is a journey, there is always next time," Matheus enthused.

The first and second winners both won a trip to Beijing, China in July for another proficiency competition with competitors from all over the world for the first winner.

Rwandan students enrolled in the Chinese Confucius institute at the University of Rwanda (UR) on Friday showcased what they can do as far as Chinese culture and languages are concerned.

This was during the Bridge Chinese Proficiency Competitions for Rwandan college students which was held at the College of Education.

The event was attended by officials from the Ministry of Education, vice-chancellor of UR, members of the Chinese community in Rwanda and officials from the Chinese embassy led by Ambassador Pan Hejun.

The student performances portrayed diverse cultures in dances, speeches, acrobatics, oral tests in Chinese and songs.

The Confucius institute at the University of Rwanda was opened in June 2009, after friendly negotiations between the Chongqing Normal University (CQNU) from China, and the then Kigali Institute of Education, now University of Rwanda's College of Education.

It is a non-profit organisation that is primarily charged with promoting Chinese language and culture, and enhancing cultural and academic exchanges between Rwanda and China.

Speaking at the event, Prof. Murty Kopparthi, the acting principal of Rwanda's College of Business and Economics said that students should cherish such practices since they can open doors for them to go to China to further their education careers.

Professor Philip Cotton, the vice chancellor of UR said, "I am very impressed by the competition. Though I did not hear a word, I can surely tell that you people are working really hard."

Chantal Uzayisenga, a girl who acted a Chinese rap and one of the best performers of the evening said Chinese it is not as complicated as it is perceived.

"I have been in the school for about a year. It is not hard if you give it time and love to learn. I could understand every word that I was speaking," she said.

Zhang Xia, a Chinese cultural instructor at the Confucius institute said that Rwandan people are fast learners and this makes her work easy. She, however, said that one of the challenges they face is that Chinese is not a common language spoken in Rwanda or in any of the neighbouring countries and this means that the environment does not favour day to day practice of the language for the learners.

Besides the Confucius institute, other things that the Chinese embassy is doing to strengthen cultural ties include; sponsoring the Kungfuwushu competitions that happen annually, observing Chinese festivities in Rwanda for instance the spring festival and the Chinese new year that was celebrated this year in Kigali with performances, and giving bursaries to Rwandans to go to China to further their studies.

 The teaching of the Chinese language and culture is spreading out, with more institutions adopting the subject.

Last week, Luyanzi College, formerly Progressive SS, became the first secondary school in the country to teach Chinese language and culture. Chinese is the latest foreign language to be introduced in Ugandan school curriculum.

Started by Makerere's Confucius institute (CI@MAK) last year, the subject is now available to secondary schools. Last week, CI@MAK signed a memorandum of understanding with Luyanzi College, Bweyogerere to teach the subject and form a base for Uganda's relations with China in education, economy and trade relations.

"It's no longer a secret, China offers a great ideal of human resource in terms of technology and trade, there is need we interest ourselves in their culture," said Professor Oswald Ndoleriire, the director of CI@MAK.

He was speaking during a cultural festival at Luyanzi College. Prof Ndoleriire added that these agreements would facilitate the teaching of the Chinese language (Mandarin) in several secondary schools before students are able to join Makerere.

Luyanzi College principal Wang Li Hong said the move would make it possible to focus on research and outreach to help Chinese language students.

"This college has created a history of testing and evaluation, and now, to sign a pact with the CI@MAK in the Chinese domain makes us very, very proud," she said.

"We are very glad to have become a member of the global Confucius institute."

Wang added that Luyanzi and CI@MAK will continue to conduct research on the profits of the Chinese language on the international stage, and collaborate with local schools to develop Chinese-English bilingual education programmes.

For his part, Chinese ambassador to Uganda, Zhao Yali, observed that learning Chinese would help students compete in the global market, with China's rising economic and social influence.

"It's important a student or society remains ardent with language; for example, many Chinese investors coming into the region will need Chinese language speakers," Zhao said.

Earlier, the ambassador excited the gathering by first greeting them in Luganda. So far there are over 200 Chinese firms in Uganda, employing over 30,000 Ugandans.

Edaa Karungi a third-year student at CI@MAK offering bachelors BASS sang the Chinese's anthem before the festival.

"With Chinese education, the foundation for modernization and development will be boosted further; that's why there is need of more secondary schools like Luyanzi teaching Chinese," noted Karungi, a guild president at CI@MAK.

In 2013, Makerere University partnered with Xiangtan University in China to start a Confucius institute, which offers degree and certificate short courses in the Chinese language and culture.

The Co-Director of CI in UDSM, Prof Henry Muzale, says China offers five categories of scholarships both short and long term every year. "Tanzanians are missing out on scholarships offered by the government of China as a number of people applying for them are small," he says.

He further explains that the scholarships range from one academic semester to a four year bachelor degree in China and that those studying at the Institute stand the chance to attend a summer camp in China.

"The scholarship opportunities are open to young men and women to study in China," says Prof Muzale.

"The Institute covers accommodation costs of students while in China and pay half of the cost of the international airfare," says the CI Director at the UDSM. Prof Xiaozhen says Summer Camp has become a vital platform for foreign students learning Chinese to mingle with Chinese students in their efforts to improve Chinese language.

"The number of Tanzanians taking part in Chinese Summer Camp has gone up from 40 students in 2014, to sixty-seven students in 2015," she observes.

According to her, the main objective of CI is to meet the Tanzania's growing need of understanding Chinese language, culture, technology and skills to increase mutual understanding among the peoples of China and Tanzania.

Feb 24, 2016 (Tanzania Daily News/All Africa Global Media) -- Last week, the name Congcong Wang from Feza Girls Secondary school hit headlines in many newspapers and it went viral on social media networks.

The Chinese girl emerged the second best student in the just released National Form IV examination results (for 2015 exams) but more surprisingly she scored grade B in Kiswahili. It quite long since the Chinese government opened its doors to international scholarship in the populous Asian nation for enhancing international relations.

China established its Confucius institute (Hanban) with the objective of teaching Chinese language and culture to foreign students to equip them with knowledge in communication while engaging them to either business or academic matters.

The major goal is to favour China's strategy of furthering international cooperation to drive the global economy through the spread of Chinese language and culture among nations. The Director of the Confucius institute at the University of Dodoma (CIUDOM), Ms Amber Zheng, is delighted by the acceptability of Chinese via the Confucius institute.

"Many students, especially at college level, are much interested to join the course for learning Chinese and culture once they hear about it. But after a while, others lose interest and abandon the course," she says. China has established a programme where students have an opportunity to learn Chinese language and culture to enable them join Chinese universities through the Confucius institute scholarship.

The benefits are said to be many as students will be in a position to get more knowledge to enable China strengthen its foreign policy. China has crafted a new investment policy directed at African countries widen the teaching of science and technology.

This is a golden opportunity for Tanzanian youth to broaden their knowledge and linguistic ability in the changing global socio-economic environment. Unfortunately, many Tanzanian young men and women are not aware or not interested with this opportunity to study in China.

The Confucius institute is an international mechanism used by China to teach Chinese and culture worldwide, having more than 400 branches at universities. In Tanzania, Confucius institute is working with several schools and colleges since 2013 and to date a total of 2,000 students have qualified in reading and speaking Chinese. Furthermore, 10 students are proceeding with their studies at Masters Degree level, another 16 are receiving Chinese language training in China through the Confucius institute Scholarship.

China has a variety of options at many universities which foster modern global technologies -- communications, civil engineering, automation and medicine. The Confucius institute offers six categories of scholarship which are divided into Masters and Bachelor Degree levels.

At Masters Degree level students opt to take MA in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other languages (MTCSOL) and another option is scholarship for one academic year plus MTCSOL students. Students take one-year language training then enter degree courses.

According to Zheng, other scholarships are four-academicyear scholarship in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Language (BTCSOL) students and also another is scholarship for one academic year. Final scholarships are one semester study students and scholarship for four weeks. Tanzania has introduced Chinese language teaching in its education system.

A-level secondary students now have the opportunity to apply for Bachelor's Degree in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other languages (BTCSOL) as long as they pass HSK Level3 (Chinese Proficiency Test) or in Chinese language means (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi - HSK).

For students pursuing a Masters Degree in Teaching Chinese Speakers of Other language (MTCSOL), HSK Level 5 is required, Zheng says.A Chinese teacher at CIUDOM, Teng Penpeng, says "I'm happy with my Tanzanian students in the class. Most of them are smart, eager to learn the language while few of them attend lectures."

He says his students granted with CI scholarship are now studying at Haerbin Normal University in China. Chen Huimin, a Chinese teacher who works with the Secondary School Chinese Language Programme, says "I like my students at Dodoma Secondary School and Kiwanja cha Ndege Secondary School because they are calm and attentive most of the time when learning Chinese."

"They are quick to learn each and everything they are taught in their classes. I will ensure some students will be granted with CI scholarship after they finish their A-Level studies," she adds. What do students say about learning Chinese?

"Learning Chinese and culture is an enjoyable course as it brings a student new knowledge," says 21-year-old Amos Kisamo, a Bachelor of Commerce in International Business student.

The world is now a village; we need to experience multicultural knowledge and experiences therefore knowing three or four international languages is recommended," argues Mr Kisamo. "Knowing Chinese language and culture is a golden opportunity which opens a new window for success in life." Samwel Manga, 23, says he enjoys the course in Chinese language.

"Chinese teachers at the University of Dodoma are cooperative and committed," he explains. "Their teaching methodology is good because they enable students understand. Chinese teachers are committed and dedicated workers."

With the support of the Chinese Embassy in Dar es Salaam, a China agency named Soma China Consulting, helps students and parents to look for appropriate universities in China according to their preference. The core objective of this agency is to assist Tanzanian students who need to apply for Chinese scholarship to familiarise themselves with the required procedures.

Soma China Consulting managing director, Ms Ru Lin, says his organisation has direct connection with various Chinese universities which may enable qualified candidates from Tanzania to join those institutions.

"Because China is a very big country and universities are spread all the populous nation, it is difficult for a normal student or parent from Tanzania to know which university is suitable for his/her interest; so the agency reduces this complication," she says.

Director of the Institute, Prof. Segun Awonusi, in his welcome remarks, said, "Spring festival is the most elaborate and colourful festival in China.

Commenting on what Nigeria hopes to gain from its relationship with China, Awonusi noted that China is not what it used to be five years ago.

According to him, the country is moving very fast and we have to emulate them not only in aping their custom, but also getting them to appreciate ours.

The don noted that the only way to catch up with country with its fast growing economy is for Nigerians to understand their language and use it to access their technology to develop the country.

Speaking at the event, the Chinese Director of the institute, Prof Jiang Lirong, noted that no matter where a Chinese is, he/she tries to reunite with his/her family to celebrate the festival.

Students and teachers of the institute put up a superlative performance, using Chinese. Also, students of the institute played games with students from selected secondary schools.

The Confucius institute at Karachi University is playing a pivotal role for the promotion of Chinese language and culture which will open new gateways for strengthening academic ties between our two brotherly nations.

This was stated by the Consul General of China in Karachi, Ma Yaou.

He was speaking at a programme organized by the Confucius institute in collaboration of Chinese Consulate in Karachi in connection with the Chinese new year.

The Vice-Chancellor of Karachi University, Prof. Dr. Mohammad Qaiser said that Pak China friendly ties are very old and the both nations are time tested friends.

He said that China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a bright example of the strong friendship of Pakistan and China and it will further the ties.

China has achieved tremendous development in almost every sector of life and has risen as the upcoming economic giant.

The Vice-Chancellor said that shortly after the founding of New China in 1949, the two countries began their diplomatic ties and have ever since maintained close and friendly cooperative relations in various fields like politics, economy as well as culture.

The governments of the two countries signed the Cultural Cooperation Agreement between Pakistan and China on March 25, 1965.

China annually offers 65 scholarships to Pakistan while Pakistan annually offers six scholarships to China. China-Pak cultural exchanges and cooperation have made continuous headway ever since the diplomatic ties of the two countries.

Both the countries have sent cultural delegations to each other and that has been welcomed by both the nations.

It was further pointed out that learning of Chinese language and culture is the dire need of today's world.

China's ambassador to Senegal Zhang Xun on Wednesday handed over to Senegalese authorities the keys to the building hosting the Dakar Confucius institute, an official source said.

The building which was constructed within Cheikh Anta Diop University, was funded by the Chinese government at a cost of 1.5 billion CFA Francs (2.5 million U.S. dollars).

"Since its establishment in December 2012, the Confucius institute at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar has become a window for Senegalese youths to know more about China and understand Chinese culture," Zhang said.

The institute has so far recruited over 600 students and started offering Chinese language lessons in other universities, colleges and schools across the country.

In October last year, the institute successfully organized a competition focusing on knowledge of Sino-Africa relations.

"China will continue to reinforce exchanges and mutual aspirations on the cultural front with Senegal. In future, the Chinese part will continue to intensify, as always, the exchanges and professional contacts at all levels between China and Senegal," the Chinese ambassador said.

Zhang said each year, China gives 30 scholarships to Senegalese students to study in China.

The vice-chancellor of Cheikh Anta Diop University Ibrahim Thioub said Senegal had "exceptional privilege" to have such a building which he described as "an architectural masterpiece."

The building has seven lecture halls with capacity to hold 40 students, a multi-media hall, an amphitheatre and a library.

Volunteer teachers from the Confucius institute entertained the community here on Feb. 9 by performing segments of the Peking Opera during the city's Spring Festival celebration.

The institute has deployed a virtual army of teachers around the world to teach the Chinese language and share their heritage in select senior high schools under the K-12 Basic Education Program.

The teachers donned period costumes, performed acrobatic tricks and sang operatic Mandarin tunes.

Mandarin is included in the foreign language course-one of the specialized core courses-of the new senior high school program.

According to the government's K-12 program website, the senior high school program is two years of specialized upper secondary education.

Students may choose a specialization based on aptitude, interests and school capacity. The choice of career track (academic; technical-vocational-livelihood; and sports and arts) will define the content of the subjects a student will take in Grades 11 and 12, the website said.

Chen Yanyi, a member of the visiting teachers' group, said the volunteers were here to scout for universities that would partner with the institute.

Chen said the volunteer teachers faced a huge task.

Most Filipinos only know the words, 'siomai' and 'siopao' so we want to share more of our culture, she said.

Not a centavo spent

Zhang Shifang, a teacher, said 76 Chinese volunteer teachers had been deployed to different schools all over the country.

These schools do not spend a centavo for the volunteers, who are paid by the Chinese government, she said.

The institute also trains Filipino scholars. The first batch of graduates of the Mandarin course at the Fujian Normal University in 2010 included Cavin Pamintuan, a Filipino language teacher.

The reformed K-12 curriculum will soon be part of the web service offered for free by the London-based education technology company, Quipper, in areas such as Bontoc town in Mt. Province.

Quipper serves as a supplementary teaching aid. The service allows teachers free access to hundreds of lessons and test quizzes on English, Math and Science.

Teachers can assign lessons and tests to their students online while students can go through tutorials on their computers and mobile devices.

In November, a Quipper school was launched in Bontoc despite the weak Internet signal there, said Gloria Buya-ao, Mt. Province schools division superintendent.

Quipper country manager Yuki Naotori said the company was preparing to incorporate the K-12 program syllabus for school year 2016-17 in the website's contents.

Specialized courses

The K-12 reforms may also produce new specialized courses at the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) soon to suit the demands of the Armed Forces service units like the Army, Air Force and Navy, said Maj. Gen. Oscar Lopez, former PMA superintendent.

Lopez relinquished his post to Maj. Gen. Donato San Juan II in a Feb. 13 ceremony. He was praised by Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Hernando Iriberri for studying the impact of K-12 reforms on the PMA resulting in the rewriting of the curriculum and recruitment system.

Lopez said the PMA curriculum lost its general education subjects to Grades 11 and 12 under the reformed basic education law.

We are still conducting consultations and we have tapped the expertise of the University of the Philippines. A technical working committee will have to determine if we need additional majors or technical subjects, he said.

 The venue for the 2016 Chinese New Year Celebrations-the University of Rwanda's College of Education in Kimironko was symbolic: This is where the Confucius institute, where young Rwandans get instruction in the Chinese language and culture from Chinese instructors is located.

The Chinese New Year, also called the Spring Festival, boasts a history that can be traced back to more than 4,000 years. It is the biggest and most important event for Chinese people-in fact, it has been said that what Christmas is to the Western world, the Spring Festival is to the Chinese.

It is the longest public holiday on the Chinese calendar, a festival that lasts for 15 days from the 1st to 15th day of the first lunar month.

According to Yang Guizhong, a representative of the political department of the Chinese Embassy in Kigali, the celebrations start even earlier in Chinese folklore, from the 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month.

"During the festival, people visit friends and make dumplings and cook all kinds of food. The children especially like this festival very much because they get pocket money given to them by elders," he explained.

"After January 1 people begin to visit each other, from relatives to friends and workmates and teachers to express their good wishes for the New Year."

Chinese culture showcased

To mark this year's celebrations in Rwanda, the Liaoning Art Troupe from China held the audience spell-bound with performances that ranged from dances, puppet shows, to acrobatics.

The artists from Liaoning endeavored to present an excellent show marked by passion and spirit.

For this year's festival, the Liaoning Troupe visited three African countries; Rwanda, Senegal and Benin.

The live performances are meant to act as an entry point into the culture of the people of China in the host country. As Yang puts it, "to promote the excellent traditional Chinese culture and to strengthen the international cultural exchanges and cooperation."

Among the variety of performances showcased on the night, by far the most crowd-impressing was Chuan Bang, an acrobatics showpiece by the famed Chinese acrobats Gao Weisong and Zhang Zhe.

Their object-juggling skills and acrobatic maneuvers earned them wild applause in an audience that had initially taken to enjoying the performances in silence.

The climax was when the two suited acrobats, standing and facing each other from a distance started to peel of their clothes one by one, tossing whatever had been removed to the other guy, while at the same time catching what had been thrown to them mid air and wearing it. In the end, the two men were wearing each other's shirts and suits.

Turning to the crowd, the single most whispered phrase during the acrobatics session was; "These people use magic".

But those that dare to dig deeper than the surface will of course soon learn that it's all down to skill and discipline and hard work: It was good that there was a slew of young Rwandan performers who joined their Chinese counterparts on stage for some of the acrobatics skits.

Most of these were drawn from the Chinese-run Confucius institute, a stone's throw away from the conference hall where the event was staged.

Here, young Rwandans are introduced to the basics of Chinese culture, from the language, the philosophy of China, to acrobatics.

The sight of these young Rwandans performing on the same stage with experienced Chinese acrobats perhaps helped quell the widespread notion that acrobats use supernatural powers -or "magic" as some members of the crowd kept insisting throughout the performance.

Away from the acrobats, the other crowd favourites were the puppet and dance shows, and talking of dance, it was good to see members of the Rwanda National Ballet strut confidently onto stage for some joint dance performances.

"This is an important cultural exchange event between China and Rwanda through which we share our happiness for the most important festival for the people of China with our Rwandan friends," remarked Yang after the event.

"This year 2016 actually marks the 45th anniversary since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Rwanda.

We hope that with such events we can get to know more about each other and our rich cultures, that's why this event was co-hosted by the Ministry of Sports and Culture of Rwanda (MINISPOC) and the Chinese Embassy.

This is actually the third time that the same group is coming to Rwanda, and I think in coming years they will come more times as China and Rwanda get closer and closer in their bilateral cooperation."

Holiday Origins from Monster Nian

The Chinese New Year celebration originated during the Shang Dynasty (17th - 11th century BC). The festival used to be observed to fight against the monster "Nian" who liked to eat children and livestock. The monster was afraid of red colour and loud sound. Therefore, people decorated their houses in red and set off firecrackers to expel it.

Based on Chinese lunar calendar, the New Year has no exact date and it changes each year, but it mostly falls on a day from January 21st to February 20th in Gregorian calendar. The lunar calendar also defines the 12-year repeating cycle of Chinese zodiac, and each year is named after an animal.

The 2016 New Year was named "The Year of the Monkey".

As the Chinese language lessons are becoming increasingly popular in the Northern Zone, the Confucius institute at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) has announced to introduce ordinary Diploma Course in Chinese language this year aimed at preparing local Chinese language teachers.

While in Northern Zone the demand of learning the language is for diverse parties seeking to tap tourist, business and cultural opportunities, while the Confucius institute at the University of Dar es Salaam is aimed at preparing local Chinese language teachers.

In Northern Zone, the lessons are being conducted at some places, including Majengo Secondary School, Tanzania Police School (TPS) and Moshi Co-operative University (MoCU).

The Chinese language teacher, Ms Monica Long Guizhen, said here that she expects to get some volunteers soon, because of increasing number of students.

So far, at MoCU, there are 50 students, 15 outsiders, 24 at TPS, while at Majengo Secondary School there are 60 students. Chinese language lessons are run under Confucius institute that was established in 2004.

Speaking at Chinese Spring Festival held here, Ms Monica said teaching Chinese language in Kilimanjaro region was agreed because there are many tourist attractions and that many Chinese tourists visit the region.

"More and more Chinese companies and businessmen come here; the demand of Chinese language teaching is increasing. A manager of one Chinese company in Moshi once told me that if graduates can speak Chinese, he would pay them a very competitive salary," said Ms Monica.

She initiated the classes in December 2015 at MoCU; and at the same time established short-term courses and there are six levels of the course that last for about three months.

Chinese language has many dialects, but what is taught at Moshi is Mandarin, the common speech or standard Chinese. Ms Monica said Chinese language is a different language from English and Kiswahili, difficult but worth to learn.

Speaking at the festival, Mocu Vice-Chancellor, Professor Faustine Bee said the varsity will continue collaboration with the Confucius Centre and build good global citizens. He said that in future they wish to establish a degree course on tourism and invite students from within and outside the country and that will see many tourists coming from China as well.

Meanwhile, The Confucius institute at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) will this year introduce ordinary Diploma Course in Chinese language aimed at preparing local Chinese language teachers.

The CI Director, Dr Prof Zhang Xiozhen, said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the two-year course would help to address a shortage of Chinese language teachers to primary and secondary schools offering the course in the country.

"We're also going to introduce a BA in Education programme of Chinese language next year with the purpose of preparing enough local Chinese language teachers," said the CI Director during the Chinese New Year.

The Chinese language is being taught as an optional subject at primary and secondary schools in the country. Prof Xiozhen pointed out that the programmes at CI cover Basic Chinese language, Chinese listening skills, oral Chinese skills, Chinese songs, Taiji course, Chinese calligraphy and traditional Chinese painting.

"The goal of the institute is to promote and teach Chinese language and culture around the world," she observed. She further said students who are learning Chinese language at the CI have an opportunity to take part in Chinese Summer Camp in China, saying the three-week programme covers comprehensive Chinese, Chinese listening and speaking.

She said the CI covers for accommodation costs of students while in China and pay half the international airfare. According to Prof Henry Muzale, who is the Co-Director of CI at the UDSM, Tanzanians were missing out scholarships offered by China through the CI as there was few candidates turning up for the chance.

Nov 24, 2015 (Liberian Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- A professor and administrator of the University of Liberia has expressed his amazement over the growth of the Confucius institute (CI) on the campus of the university.

Confucius institute is part of the Chinese Language Teaching Program established on the UL campus to serve as a cultural exchange for interested Liberians.

During activities marking the celebration of the institute's 7th anniversary, observed on November 22, UL professor, Debby Syndee, said the Institute is building relations between Liberia and the People's Republic of China, and that its association with the UL Administration is a welcomed venture.

Professor Syndee said many Liberian students can now speak Chinese and have visited China, giving the impression that peoples of both countries can now better understand each other.

Dr. Huang Jian, CI's Co-Director, commended the staff for their contributions in making the institute vibrant and enabling the students to learn the Chinese language.

He said that in seven years, the Institute has grown from "baby to boy," assuring that it will very soon become a full grown institution with the help of every stakeholder.

He added that during the health crisis that brought setbacks to the country's economy and put people at risk, the Chinese remained here and the Institute continued to operate.

At the program, 16 students received diplomas in the Chinese language, while the CI's artistic choir kept the audience spellbound.

Meanwhile, CI Director, Dr. Bah, recounted the achievements of the Institute during the post-Ebola period, believing that CI is a good platform for Liberians to know China and speak the language and learn the culture.

He urged Liberian students learning the Chinese language to dedicate themselves and use the available opportunities before them in China.

The University of Zimbabwe on Friday launched the first ever Chinese-Shona dictionary alongside five other books as the country's oldest institution of higher learning moves to advance intercultural exchanges between people of the two nations. The "Shona-Chinese-Chinese-Shona Dictionary" was produced by the Confucius institute (CI) in collaboration with the Department of Linguistics at the university.

It is divided into two parts, the first part being a Shona-Chinese section composed of about 1500 frequently used Shona main headwords. The second section of the dictionary is a Chinese-Shona part where Chinese words are the main headwords and is composed of about 1 250 frequently used Chinese words. CI director and one of the editors of the dictionary Pedzisai Mashiri said the dictionary will assist in the dissemination of Chinese knowledge and culture and also assist Zimbabweans who want to learn Chinese as well as Chinese people who want to learn Shona.

Shona is one of the major local languages in Zimbabwe. Mashiri said since the institution was playing a leading role in promoting intercultural exchange between Zimbabwe and China, the best way to strengthen those bilateral relations was to have cultural exchange which was mutual.

"The tendency has been to emphasise us learning Chinese without paying attention to the Chinese themselves learning our local languages and so because of the amount of investment and amount of interaction that is taking place between us and the Chinese, it will be productive and wise for them to start learning local languages and Shona being the major languages in Zimbabwe this dictionary will act as a vehicle for promoting that cultural exchange," he said.

University of Zimbabwe Vice Chancellor Levi Nyagura said the dictionary will enhance cultural interaction between people of the two countries. "We want to promote this important interaction between the two cultures and there is nothing better than focusing on the vehicle that carries the culture of a people and this is the language," Nyagura said.

By producing the dictionary, the university was promoting the development of a stronger bridge between the people of Zimbabwe and China, he said. The director of higher education programmes in the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Martha Muguti, said the dictionary was a catalyst that bridges the gap between China and Zimbabwe.

"The history of the Sino-Zimbabwe political and economic ties would not be complete without the peoples of these great countries reaching deeper into their recesses of each other's cultures that are deeply embedded in these countries' common languages," she said.

The University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) in Quezon City inaugurated recently the Confucius institute (CI), an academic unit offering Chinese language and culture classes partially funded by the Chinese government.

Establishing the institute on campus was a step in the right direction, said UP president Alfredo Pascual.

UPD chancellor Michael Tan said CI-UPD, supervised by the Office of Chinese Language Council International (Hanban), with the help of Xiamen University (XMU) in Fujian, China, would pave the way for many exchanges in various fields in Arts and Humanities, Social and Natural Sciences, Engineering and, with our other UP units, in Agriculture, Fisheries and Medicine.

CI aims to foster cooperation between the peoples of China and the Philippines, Tan said in his opening remarks during inauguration ceremonies at the university theater.

Many Filipinos have Chinese ancestry reflected not only in our surnames but in our outlook and perspectives in life. Many of us appreciate our Chinese roots but we know that we are now Filipinos and the Philippines is our own land, Tan said.

As the two countries continue to dispute sovereignty over the West Philippine Sea, Tan said in an interview that we have to keep talking to each other. We cannot just keep saber rattling and all.

There are a lot of relationships between China and the Philippines and we have to contribute to that. War comes about when people stop talking, he added.

Better communication

Teaching appreciation of Chinese culture and history, through courses on China at the university, has always been geared toward Philippine development, Pascual said.

The CI in UPD, the fourth in the country, represents the need for greater mutual understanding, respect and appreciation between our two cultures, our two peoples, Pascual said.

The first three institutes are at Ateneo de Manila University in Quezon City and Makati City, Bulacan State University in Malolos City, and Angeles University Foundation in Pampanga.

The number of CIs worldwide has grown to over 1,000 since the first institute opened in Seoul, South Korea, on Nov. 21, 2004. Among the universities with CIs are Stanford University and Columbia University in the United States, London School of Economics in the United Kingdom, Paris Diderot University in France, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and Waseda University in Japan.

The institute, named after the most famous Chinese philosopher, promotes China's language and culture and serves as a bridge reinforcing friendship and cooperation between China and the rest of the world, according to its website.

It is often compared to Germany's Goethe-Institut, France's Alliance Francaise and UK's British Council.

But unlike its European counterparts which are stand-alone organizations, the CI is associated with the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China and was established in partnership with universities around the globe.

The Hanban, also called the CI headquarters of China, assigns a Chinese university affiliate to oversee the implementation of the teaching program.

Pascual and Hanban chief executive Xu Lin signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) on Dec. 7 last year to set up the CI at UPD.

Under the MOA, Hanban is obliged to provide teaching materials, courseware and books. The council is expected to give the university up to 3,000 volumes of Chinese books, teaching materials and audiovisual materials for the institute's opening next year.

Tan also sealed an implementation agreement with Zhu Chongshi, president of XMU, the designated Chinese institution.

Based on the agreement, a board of advisers composed of representatives from both universities will be responsible for CI's operation, formulation and approval of curricula for the teaching program, and financial and recruitment plans.

The agreement also states that XMU shall provide one or two visiting scholars or instructors on Chinese language and culture every year, as well as textbooks, reference and audiovisual materials for teaching.

The XMU president, who spoke at the inauguration, said UP and the Chinese university had frequent communication and exchanges since 2000 on various fields such as Natural Sciences, Engineering and Technology.

The coestablishment of CI symbolizes another step forward in this collaboration, he said through an interpreter.

Next semester, Chinese language courses would be offered to UP students and outsiders but the rates to be charged for the classes had yet to be finalized, Tan said.

The language classes will be handled by Chinese teachers.

Tan explained that the CI provided accreditation similar to that of the Test of English as a Foreign Language proficiency assessment that could be used as official proof of mastery of the Chinese language for job application.

The 240-square-meter CI-UPD temporary office with 10 rooms is located at the Advanced Science and Technology Institute along C.P. Garcia Avenue.

Tan said the CI office would be transferred to the renovated International Center in two years.

Pascual said in his closing remarks that the need for mutual communication cannot be overstated, as various issues beset the country's relations with China.

Oct 14, 2015 (Liberian Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Confucius institute teaching the Chinese Language at the University of Liberia (UL) has begun preparing competent and qualified students for scholarships and fellowships to universities in the People's Republic of China.

Authorities of the Institute have urged the students to process their passports, because the institute could call on them at any time in November to go to Beijing to attend a two-week fellowship or two-year scholarship program.

During an exhibition of the students' competence in the Chinese Language, the students took a written test and then conversed with their instructors in Chinese.

The 11 students, three women and eight men who went through the testing exercise on October 10, performed several Chinese cultural activities, which included singing.

The Confucius institute is yet to disclose the names of successful candidates going to Beijin, however Grace Mensah, Peter Sumo, Boakai Wilson and Archie Luo were among the top performers who fluently conversed with their instructors without English interpretation or hitches.

It is therefore certain that, depending on the number of persons the institute will choose, any of these performers stands the chance of benefitting from the opportunities.

The Confucius institute is the educational component of the China-Africa Relations responsible for teaching Chinese Language and Culture to Africans as a means of building trust and confidence between the two.

In December 2008, the institute was established on UL campus as the first in West Africa.

It was jointly established by Changsha University of Science and Technology and the UL with the aim to teach Chinese Language and Culture to interested Liberians.

The institute has extended its programs to officers of the Liberia National Police and the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization since they are the first paramilitary personnel that interact with the public daily.

This educational component of China-Liberia relations includes full scholarship for three years of study for a Master's degree in China, one year of study to learn the Chinese language and Culture, Chinese Ambassador Scholarship for one month cultural experience and two-week summer/winter camp trip to China.

Meanwhile, the program has led many young Liberians to the People's Republic of China for studies in various disciplines including Medicine, Education and other areas of Science.

About two months ago, over 20 Liberians left Liberia to pursue Master's degrees in various disciplines in China.

The 11th anniversary of the Global Confucius institute was celebrated in Yaounde on September 30, 2015.

The Confucius institute and 'Les Degourdis' school at Montee Jouvence, Biyem-Assi, Yaounde on September 30, 2015, celebrated the first anniversary of their Chinese language and culture learning partnership in the campus of the school. The celebration was also to mark the 11th anniversary of the Global Confucius institute.

The anniversary, which happened to be the eighth to be celebrated in Cameroon, held at 'Les Degourdis' for the first time. The celebration was in the presence of the Head Teacher of 'Les Degourdis,' Lydie Akam Evina, the Director of Confucius institute, Yu Guoyang and staff of both schools. Lydie Akam Evina expressed her profound gratitude to Confucius institute for choosing their school to celebrate the anniversary. "The launch and anniversary of our partnership is to show the positive things we can emulate such as learning Chinese culture," she said.

Pupils of the school performed Chinese songs and also did recitations in the language. Some 10 Class One pupils dressed in pink short gowns, thighs and white stockings and holding Chinese hand fans, twisted their waists and waved the fans as they danced to the sound of Chinese music. At the end of the musical interlude, they came together and raised their fans high in an apparent sign of peace. Their performance was highly applauded.

The Chinese Ambassador to Rwanda, Shen Yongxiang, and other members of the Chinese community in the country marked their country's Martyrs' Day with a ceremony in Rulindo District to honour their deceased compatriots on Wednesday.

The ceremony, at the Chinese Martyrs' Cemetery in Rulindo, was also attended by aid workers, teachers, volunteers of Confucius institute and Rwanda government officials.

Chinese Martyrs' Day falls on September 30. It was adopted last year to raise public awareness of the nation's heroes and forge a sense of national unity.

China defines martyrs as those who lost their lives for national independence and prosperity, as well as for the welfare of the people in modern times from the First Opium War in 1840 to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

In Rulindo, the group remembered and paid respect to Chinese Martyr-Chen Jian and other Chinese who died in Rwanda.

"Today, we pay maximum respect to our beloved comrades and comfort our martyrs and deceased compatriots for their struggle and sacrifice for the national independence, liberation and prosperity. Without martyrs, there would be no today's new China, today's national prosperity, happiness and even the corporation with other countries like Rwanda," Amb. Shen said.

Shen noted that more than 40 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, numerous Chinese experts, medical workers, engineers and technicians come to Rwanda, working hand in hand with local people and making great contribution to Rwanda's development.

"Some even rest eternally in Rwanda's land. Chen Jian was the most outstanding representative. Chinese and Rwandan people will never forget their deeds. They will live forever in our hearts. I hope all Chinese in Rwanda will inherit the will of the martyrs, making new contribution to Rwanda social development and Sino-Rwanda friendship," he added.

Chen Jian worked for the Gitarama-Kibuye road onstruction project. In June 1997, while transporting construction materials, he is said to have bravely fought armed robbers to protect aid project property, but lost his life. He was conferred the title of martyr by Beijing.

Eugene Fixer Ngoga, the director-general of bilateral corporation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said it's meaningful to the government to commiserate with Chinese government, the people who died for good cause in the country.

"On behalf of the government, we are honored to get together with Chinese embassy to remember these people and we recognise the work of the Chinese government in our country. People need to understand the level of sacrifice of these comrades and that we should learn never to underestimate personal efforts of people in any country's development," he said.

"They left their country and families and came here to partner with Rwanda so that they can contribute to our development. They unfortunately passed away doing the activities that were aimed at helping Rwanda and Rwandans. There's therefore a reason to honor and remember them."

Rulindo Chinese Cemetery was built in 1982. From 1982 to 1997, a total of 10 Chinese who passed on working in aid projects in Rwanda were buried there.

Prof. He Yi, Chinese Co-Director of the Confucius institute at the University of Zambia,

Dr. Sande Nglande, Zambian Co-Director of the Confucius institute at the University of Zambia,

Mr. Henry Kwalombota, Headteacher of Rhodes Park School,

Teachers and Students,

Friends from the media,

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good afternoon!

September is a season when you see Jacaranda trees in full blossom in Zambia. The purple flowers have made Lusaka a more charming and romantic city. In such a beautiful season, I am very happy to be here together with you to celebrate the 2015 Global Confucius institute Day and the Inauguration of the Rhodes Park School Confucius Classroom.

In 2014, the Headquarter of the Confucius institute of China designated 27th September as the first Global Confucius institute Day. Celebrations were held at more than 1,200 Confucius institutes or Confucius Classrooms all over the world, including at UNZA. Confucius institutes have become a platform for the promotion of Chinese language and culture, a window for the people across the world to get to know China, a showground for intercultural exchanges and also a positive force for building a harmonious world. Since the establishment of the Confucius institute at UNZA in 2010, with joint efforts from both the Chinese and Zambian sides, Chinese language teaching has been gradually expanded in Zambia. Chinese degree courses have been set up in UNZA and Mulungushi University, Chinese language classes have been opened in secondary schools in all the 10 provinces of Zambia with around 7,200 Zambian students. All these achievements could not have been made without the consistent efforts by both the Chinese and Zambian teachers, to whom I would like to pay my most humble tribute on behalf of the Chinese Embassy and in my own name.

Your Honorable, Ladies and Gentlemen,

With the approval of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Confucius Classrooms are created to promote Chinese language and Chinese culture in primary and secondary schools in other countries. I am happy to see that Confucius Classrooms at Rhodes Park School and Luanshya Trust School have been approved. As far as I know, since Rhodes Park School introduced Chinese language teaching in 2011, more than 800 students have studied or are studying Chinese language here. With the inauguration of the Confucius Classroom, both the Chinese and Zambian sides will increase our input in the endeavor so as to provide a good platform for Zambian primary and secondary school students to study Chinese language and get to know Chinese culture.

Your Honorable, Ladies and Gentlemen,

As you know, H.E. President Lungu concluded a successful state visit to China in March this year, and reached extensive new consensus on the development of China-Zambia relations with H.E. Xi Jinping, President of China. The bilateral relationship between China and Zambia has entered into a new era of comprehensive development. The cooperation in the area of economic and trade as well as people-to-people and culture exchanges between our two countries are flourishing. The mutual understanding and the friendship of our two peoples are deepening. Not long ago, the preliminary contest for "Chinese Bridge" Chinese language competition for college students and secondary school students were successfully held in Zambia for the first time. These are the top competitions for worldwide students learning Chinese, known as the "Olympic Games for Chinese language learning". The winners of the competitions in Zambia took part in the global final competition held in Beijing and achieved good results. This year, we have selected 49 Zambian students to study in China on Chinese Government Scholarship. Now the number of Zambian students studying in China amounts to a total of 1,700, of which 221 students are sponsored by the Chinese Government. China has become the most popular destination for Zambian young students to study abroad. It is a concrete demonstration of the rapid development of people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and Zambia.

Your Honorable, Ladies and Gentlemen,

"Amity between people holds the key to sound relations between states, communication between minds holds the key to amity between people". Learning Chinese can open a window for people to get to know Chinese culture and build a bridge to communicate between different people. Mastering Chinese language can also help to increase opportunities for one's life. I hope the Confucius institute and the Confucius Classrooms in Zambia will make continued efforts in exploring new ways of development, in sowing more seeds of communication and exchanges to take roots in Zambia, to harvest more fruits of friendship and cooperation.

Thank you very much!

 The Confucius institute Day was observed here Friday with a colorful ceremony at the Risingsun Montessori, a privately-owned school in Ghana's capital.

The Day, which was organized by the Confucius institute at the University of Ghana, Legon, was marked to commemorate the achievements of the Institute during its 11 years of existence globally.

Confucius institute is an education and cultural exchange organization set up by Hanban of China in all parts of the world to spread Chinese language teaching and culture.

The lively ceremony saw performances of Chinese Tea culture, Taichi, varying musical performances and dances by students of the Institute at the University of Ghana.

Children of the Risingsun Montessori also performed Chinese songs and recitals much to the admiration of the audience.

Participants had the opportunity to experience firsthand Chinese culture and language by taking part in Chinese language lessons, Chinese martial art lessons, experiencing Chinese calligraphy and painting of facial masks of Peking opera.

The Director of the Confucius institute, Dr Mei Meilian, said the institute had been offering Chinese language proficiency and culture courses for more than 1,800 students from the public and its four teaching sites.

She said the institute was happy to have programs in schools and communities off the University of Ghana where it is located to help more Ghanaians to know about Chinese language and culture.

"We are happy to have our program at Risingsun Montessori School today and we will be happy to have it at other schools such as Kwabenya schools tomorrow. We are happy to go anywhere Ghanaian people need us to," she said.

The Director of the Risingsun Montessori School, Patrick Acheampong, said the school's collaboration with the Confucius institute was one such of numerous programs which he believed would make the students multi-cultural.

"We believe that 20 years from now, every child from Ghana should be able to walk on the streets of Beijing and walk freely and communicate as if they were born and bred there. It shall come to pass."

The Political Counselor of the Chinese Embassy, Wang Sheng, said China was definitely not the first Asian country to come to Ghana but hoped that it should become the Asian country to understand Ghana the best.

"In this regard, the Confucius institute still has a long way to go to promote the mutual understanding between our two countries and two peoples."

Starting from scratch, the Confucius institute has developed from a small to a large number with its education scale expanding and the quality of teaching improving by the day.

Kenya's Njeri Mwangi looks forward to working in a Chinese-owned company either in Kenya or China, an interest built out of her interaction with the country's citizens and their culture.

She is among the 15 students currently undertaking a certificate of Chinese language at Egerton University's Confucius institute in Nakuru County, Kenya's Rift Valley region.

"I love Chinese language. It is a very interesting language that I would encourage everyone to learn," Mwangi told Xinhua in an interview with her at the university.

Mwangi, presently at Level IV, said she has learnt a lot about the Chinese language, tradition, culture and history.

Combined with the knowledge she has gained from her degree in Economics and Sociology, Mwangi said she is confident of securing employment in a company managed by the Chinese.

"I am currently in my fourth year and soon as I graduate, my focus will be looking for a job at a Chinese company," she said.

And getting a job as an accountant could be to her greatest satisfaction as she said.

Remarkably, her visit to China early this year further fueled her interest of wishing to work with the China nationals.

The full sponsored tour that lasted for two weeks exposed her to the high technological developments advanced in the country. The people were equally warm, friendly, cordial and jovial as she observed.

During the January trip, they visited Shanghai and Suzhou, some of the most developed and prosperous cities of China as well as the Nanjing Agricultural University.

The rubbish free streets, well carpeted roads and complex architectural designs of the buildings amazed her.

"It is just stunning to have a feeling of the cities. They are so clean and the roads are very well developed. It is a learning lesson all together," noted Mwangi.

Though she expected to be served with spoons, forks and knives, Mwangi had to learn a new way of eating using the chopsticks.

"There are no spoons or knives we are used to in Kenya. You use chopsticks which I found to be interesting to me," said Mwangi as she laughs away the excitement of learning the new eating style.

Mwangi said learning the Chinese language supplements her academic qualifications. With the understanding of the language, she says she could comfortably serve as a teacher and translator.

She believes that with the growing industrialization in Kenya and Chinese companies setting ground in the country, graduates with a Chinese accreditation would never lack jobs.

"The Chinese are very nice people and it is my desire that one day I work with them. I would love to be working in an environment with high developments and technological growth," asserted Mwangi, adding that she is encouraging her friends to learn the language.

During Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Liu Xianfa's visit to the university on September 15, he encouraged them to learn more about the language. He also promised to support them in all endeavours.

Liu said an increasing number of Chinese companies were expanding into Kenya and could offer them employment opportunities.

"There are more employment opportunities for you as more Chinese companies are coming up in Kenya," he told the students who had converged to receive him.

Latest data on the arrival of the Chinese entrepreneurs in Kenya indicate a 93 percent increase between 2009 and 2013.

A total of 386 firms run by the Chinese had equally been registered in Kenya by the closure of 2014.

Nairobi, Sep 11, 2015 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Zhang Miao, a 24-year-old Chinese girl has always dreamt of coming to the continent of Africa. Her opportunity came when she stumbled upon an advertisement in her university in north China, Tian Jin Normal University, recruiting volunteer teachers in Africa.

The girl, who had just completed her bachelor's degree in comparative literature, arrived in Kenya early this week for a one year term as a Chinese language teacher.

She will be teaching at the University of Nairobi's Confucius institute alongside six other volunteers.

"My time in Kenya will be an adventure and I will help impart Chinese culture to the students," Zhang told Xinhua in an interview on Tuesday.

But it is not the first time the Chinese girl interacts with Kenyans as she got acquainted with Kenyan students in her university in China.

Her arrival in Kenya came a few days before China commemorates Teachers Day on Sept. 10.

"I will observe the Teacher's Day by helping to spread Chinese culture in Kenya," she said.

Zhang said that after she completes her time in Kenya, she hopes to enroll for a masters course in literature, and probably in African literature.

"I am considering focusing on African Literature given that there is very limited knowledge of African written culture in China," she said.

Li Ruxue is another Chinese volunteer teaching at the University of Nairobi's Confucius institute.

Having worked for the past six months, Li said she had acknowledged the role teachers can play in enhancing people-to-people cultural exchanges.

"We have a chance to interact with ordinary Kenyans and so as to help increase the understanding between the Kenyan and Chinese cultures," she said.

Li said there are a lot of similarities between African and Chinese culture.

"We just need to increase the exchanges for the mutual benefits of the two peoples," she said.

"I love Chinese culture and I want more people to know and understand the rich Chinese culture," she told Xinhua.

Li Yao is the two girls' co-worker. He graduated from Wuyi University in south China where he majored in English.

"Teaching Chinese in Kenya has also given me an opportunity to practice English and learn Kiswahili," Li said.

He noted that there is a lot of interest in Chinese language among Kenyan students due to the growing China-Kenya trade.

WHEN the Confucius institute (CI) was launched at the Durban University of Technology in March 2013, among the high profile guests were the visiting Chinese president, Xi Jinping - making his first diplomatic visit after his inauguration - and President Jacob Zuma.

The institute, named after Confucius, the ancient Chinese philosopher, opened its doors in February last year.

In the process DUT became the province's first, and only, tertiary institution to offer the language.

It currently has a Chinese Culture Experience Centre, a Chinese Language and Culture Resource Centre and other teaching facilities. It offers different Mandarin courses - basic, intermediate and advanced levels.

The head of the institute, Dr Eddie Chaobo Fu, a language and culture teacher, researcher and scholar, said Mandarin was one of the official languages of the UN and was one of the most widely spoken in the world.

There are currently six languages used in UN meetings - Arabic (literary Arabic), Chinese (standard Chinese, simplified Chinese characters), English (British spelling), French, Russian and Spanish.

Some of the proposed languages are Bengali, Hindi, Portuguese and Turkish.

"More and more people are learning Mandarin, especially young people, for job prospects. Others are learning it because of their interest in the Chinese language and its culture," said Fu.

"At DUT, we currently have 300 students learning Mandarin. We also have 30 professors, deans and members of staff attending. It is catching on quickly."

The institute has 40 teachers.

Fu said students were also opting to study the language to take up scholarship opportunities in China.

Two students, who opted to enrol for the basic course in July were Minenhle Khumalo and Lesley Ngaazire, both 22.

Khumalo, a second-year language practice student, was given the name Lan Ming by teacher Doris Wang.

It means "someone who is bright".

Ngaazire, a second-year office management student, is known as Chun Liang, which means "kind hearted".

Said Khumalo: "I enrolled because Mandarin is an international language and because I have discovered China has invested so much into the South African economy and is also part of Brics (the acronym for an association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa)."

He said he approved of the South African government introducing the language at schools.

"If I can speak Mandarin and English, my job opportunities will be enhanced," said Khumalo, who is also studying French.

"If I don't find work in South Africa, I can look for employment in China, Singapore and Taiwan."

He said he practised Mandarin outside of class, when greeting the vendors at the university.

Ngaazire said: "South Africa is a diverse country and it has influenced us to learn and accommodate others. We must live as one citizen and we must acknowledge each other and learn from each other - values, cultures and norms... The Chinese are here to strengthen and open chances for the economy and create trade stability."

The students and foreign language coordinators of Roots International School (RIS) were on a study tour yet again for Chinese language and cultural experience.Confucius institute Hanban in collaboration with Beijing Language and Culture University arranged the summer programme study tour.

The programme is a major short-term study abroad programme supported by Hanban since 2010. This programme has received warm welcome by thousands of participants in Confucius institute from more than 60 countries. This year a group of 100 students from Pakistan went to China under supervision of Haseeb and Sabeeha, Confucius institute Islamabad. It was an academy-style experience programme designed for international officials, teachers and students who have the demand of learning Chinese language and culture.

The RIS Department of Foreign Languages is offering Chinese language to RIS students and working to incorporate more languages under the umbrella of RFLD to expand the cultural horizons. With this vision, RIS Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Walid Mushtaq has initiated Roots Chinese Language Department (RCLD).

The main content of the programme includes practical Chinese training by professional TCSL teachers before applying Chinese language in their day-to-day matters. The participants also learnt how to conduct dialogue to Chinese experts about modern China, Chinese traditional culture, history, customs and arts.The RIS delegate experienced Chinese traditional arts and culture lessons such as Chinese calligraphy, painting, knotting and paper cutting to name a few. Furthermore, the study tour included learning Chinese ancient and modern culture by visiting Chinese scenic spots such as Great Wall, Palace Museum, Summer Palace, Heaven Temple, Forbidden City, Bird's Nest and different markets and streets. It was indeed a great learning platform for students and trainer alike. Roots International schools have always bolstered such initiatives and this tour is just one unit of the chain.

Aug 23, 2015 (Liberia News Agency/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Forty officers of the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (BIN) and the Liberia National Police (LNP) are to learn the Chinese language and culture in Liberia starting August 29.

The year-long training, which takes place at the Confucius institute at the University Of Liberia (UL), is being sponsored by the Chinese Government through its embassy near Monrovia.

Speaking at a ceremony at the Foreign Ministry Friday, the Commissioner and Commandant for Training and Manpower Development of LNP, .J. Titus Kimba, lauded the Chinese Embassy for affording the officers the opportunity to learn the Chinese culture and language.

He said the training will help reduce the language barrier with some non-English-speaking Chinese citizens residing in Liberia when officers come in contact with them.

He then praised Chinese residents for being law-abiding, adding that there has been no arrest of any of them for being in violation of the law.

Also in brief remark, the Director of Training at the BIN, Col. Gerye C.M.Suomie, said the BIN has included in their training curriculum French and Chinese culture and language to help in the discharge of their duties.

For his part, Chinese Ambassador to Liberia, Zhang Yue Zhang stated that Sino-Liberia relationship is being strengthened daily and promised China will continue its assistance to Liberia.

Zhang encouraged officers of the BIN and LNP to take advantage of the opportunity afforded them to learn a foreign language.

Aug 20, 2015 (Tanzania Daily News/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The national language of a country is the driving force behind its unity. It is what makes a country enjoy and respect beyond its borders besides its name, flag, colours and currency.

To understand and really know a country, you need to understand its national language to be able to get involved with its culture as well as understanding how that country works.

Ability to speak that country's national language creates instant friendship bonds because the natives feel more comfortable with you. Tanzania is a multitribe country, with many local languages spoken as a result.

The tribes are united by Kiswahili, which is the national language. Kiswahili is widely spoken in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and the Comoro Islands.

It is also one of the official languages of the African Union (AU) and in 2004, during a summit of African leaders in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the then Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, threw the leaders and delegates into confusion when he decided to address the meeting in Kiswahili.

Officials scrambled for interpreters but, luckily, President Chissano, who is not a native of any Kiswahili speaking country, offered to translate himself, saying he decided to use Kiswahili to further the union's pledge to promote African identity and languages.

The former president lived in Tanzania for several years at the thick of the liberation struggle against Portuguese colonialists from the mid- 1960s to mid-1970s.

According to Reuters, most African leaders and ambassadors seemed baffled and unable to understand what Mr Chissano was saying - initially; that was before they hurriedly switched to the Kiswahili mode in their interpreter kits.

A long while back, when I had an opportunity to attend one of the AU meetings in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, I wondered why only Arabic, French, English and Portuguese were in use and not Kiswahili.

When I asked one of the union's officials, he said the problem was not with the continental body speakers of the language themselves. He said if officials and leaders from the Kiswahili speaking countries were to use the language during meetings, the AU would be forced to get translators.

Early in July this year, in what looked like an impromptu decision, President Jakaya Kikwete, who was hosting visiting Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Dessalegn, decided to give his speech in Kiswahili when launching the Biolarvicides Plant in Kibaha District, forcing government officials who were clearly not prepared, to translate into English.

It is this kind of attitude and effort that is needed to show pride for Kiswahili, which is the national language for Kenya and Uganda, as well as being widely spoken in Mozambique, Burundi, Rwanda, DR Congo and the Comoros, which has also got its own corrupted version of the language.

Despite tremendous efforts to promote Kiswahili, such initiative should not end there. Kiswahili speaking nations should take the language further by offering to teach it in other countries.

The Chinese are slowly spreading their language across the world; just like the English and the French did, by teaching the languages in schools where it is much easier to grasp.

Recently, the Confucius institute of the University of Dodoma (CI-UDOM) launched a new Chinese language teaching programme in secondary schools in the country.

The Chinese language teaching programme was launched in Dar es Salaam by the Commissioner for Education in the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT), Chinese Embassy and the CI-UDOM.

The course is expected to begin in six advanced public secondary schools before it is spread to ordinary level secondary schools in future.

The CI-UDOM brought 12 young volunteer Chinese language teachers to teach the language at Benjamin Mkapa Secondary School and Chang'ombe Secondary School in Dar es Salaam, Morogoro Secondary School and Kilakala Girls Secondary School in Morogoro Region and Dodoma Secondary School and Msalato Girls Secondary School in Dodoma.

There are also centres at some higher learning institutions, including the University of Dodoma (UDOM) and the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) where one can learn the Chinese language, culture, and martial arts, kung fu.

It is high time we viewed Kiswahili with much pride and promote it along other international languages such as English, French and Spanish.

Jul 27, 2015 (Tanzania Daily News/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Sixty-seven Tanzanians learning Chinese language are on Monday expected to fly to China for a three-week Chinese Summer Camp 2015.

The students are expected to experience Chinese language and culture as part of the language course offered by the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) Confucius institute.

The Confucius institute (CI) Director, Prof Zhang Xiaozhen, said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the programme will cover comprehensive Chinese, Chinese listening and speaking.

"The Institute will cover for accommodation costs of students while in China and pay half of the cost of the international airfare," said the CI Director at the UDSM during a pre-departure meeting. The trip is the second Summer Camp to be organized by the University of Dar es Salaam.

The first camp for Tanzania students was organized between August and September last year. Prof Xiaozhen said this year's summer camp will take place at Zhejiang Normal University in Zhejiang Province, saying it shall be a vital platform for Tanzanian students to mingle with Chinese students in their efforts to improve Chinese language.

"The number of Tanzanians taking part in Chinese Summer Camp has gone up from 40 students last year, to sixty-seven students this year," she observed.

According to Prof Xiaozhen, the main objective of CI is to meet the Tanzania's growing need of understanding Chinese language, culture, technology and skills to increase mutual understanding among the peoples of China and Tanzania.

The Co-Director of CI at the University of Dar es Salaam, Prof Henry Muzale, reminded the students to be good representatives of Tanzania noting that they should maintain the country's good image.

"Every member of the group should strive to observe the cultural differences and respect other people's culture while there," he said.

Mr David Mapunda, who is one of the students, said he would make use of the Summer Camp to improve his Chinese language, saying interacting with fellow Chinese students would enable him to sharpen his Chinese language and Kung fu skills.

"This will be an ideal opportunity for me to sharpen my Chinese language and kung fu skills," he said.

State to state relationship rests on people to people relations and people to people communication form very basis of people to people friendship, partnership and working relationship, said Li.

"You will find Chinese nationals are just like ordinary Botswana people, they truly love this country and people," said Li.

The class was held on the campus of the University of Botswana, and was given by a selected teacher at CIUB. A Botswana national Gracious Masule who has 4 years Chinese learning experiences serves as an assistant tutor of the course.

Nairobi, Jun 29, 2015 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Kenyan girl Wynn Kendi created a spectacle at the University of Nairobi grounds on Friday morning as she made rhythmic steps while waving a brightly colored silk cloth.

The 21-year-old mandarin student at the university's Confucius institute has won accolades from peers and tutors for her mastery of Chinese traditional and contemporary dance.

Born and raised in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, Kendi's love for Chinese language, culture and arts blossomed after high school thanks to exposure and sheer enthusiasm.

"I was riding in a public service vehicle when I spotted the signpost of a Chinese restaurant. The eye catching signpost was written in Chinese and I could not comprehend the meaning. This marked the beginning of my quest to learn Chinese language," Kendi said.

She enrolled for a Chinese language major at the institute in May 2014 and besides eloquence, Kendi is also endowed with agility that has made it possible for her to master both Kenyan and Chinese dance.

She benefitted from a one month scholarship last December to improve her proficiency in Chinese language and dance at a reputable university in China.

Kendi participated in the Chinese language proficiency contest for Kenyan University students held in May this year.

A growing number of Kenyan youth are passionate about learning Chinese language and rich culture. They gained exposure to the rich culture of China thanks to the influence of mass media and a significant presence of Chinese nationals in the East African nation.

Kendi is not only fluent in Chinese language but has as well mastered key characters. Kendi's mastery of Chinese dance has created a buzz in Kenya's oldest university.

She noted that Chinese dance is soft, elegant and an instant hit to Kenyans who are used to aggressive dance moves. "I love silk dance and various types of opera. They are sentimental, rhythmic and authentic," Kendi told Xinhua.

Kendi's one-month stint in China last December improved her grasp of mandarin and traditional Chinese dance. She also interacted with a broad swath of the Chinese society while at the University.

"During my stay in China, I came to learn the people are very caring and warm. I loved the way people did exercise together while the food though different from ours was quite delicious," said Kendi.

She has benefitted from another Chinese government scholarship and will enroll at a university in northeast China this September to study mandarin.

"I hope my proficiency in mandarin will improve a notch higher and intends to learn more about the Chinese culture and cuisine. Likewise, I will try Chinese clothes during my stay there in September," Kendi told Xinhua.

Her future aspirations are to become an accomplished mandarin teacher and a translator.

Her tutors agreed the versatile young female student has a bright future given her quick mastery of mandarin and Chinese dance.

Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, Hon. Dr Mahendra Reddy this week received a delegation from the Confucius institute Headquarters in Hanban, China and discussed ways to capitalize on the opportunities provided by the institute.

The delegation led by the Deputy Director-General of Hanban, Mr Wang Yongli is pursuing opportunities to widen their scope of service and engage more locals in the teaching and learning of the Chinese language.

The Confucius institute at the University of the South Pacific has been offering the teaching of Chinese Language to the local and regional students enrolled at the institution. The institution is committed to imparting Chinese knowledge outside China.

Currently, Draiba Primary School and Adi Cakobau School are also taking up this language classes to deepen their understanding about the Chinese culture.

Minister Reddy expressed his appreciation to the group for their initiative and quest to promote their culture.

Fiji is happy to work with Confucius institute and train more Fijians to learn the Chinese language. Fiji is always happy to partner with institutions and countries to enhance the stock of knowledge of students and interested learners. We are also keen in securing Confucius writings and journals in our secondary schools to add depth to the learning process of our students, Minister Reddy said.

This initiative will also prepare students and interested learners to be multi lingual and gives them an edge in the competitive labour market we have locally, regionally and globally. This opportunity will also open doors of employment for locals who have keen interest in this area and will be a benefit to both the Confucius institute and the government of Fiji.

The head of the Confucius institute stated the institution was willing to provide scholarships for locals to study at their institution in China to further equip them in learning and later teaching the Chinese language.

The bilateral understanding established will reap rewarding benefits for both Fiji and China, Mr Yongli said.

The Confucius institute has established 487 institutions in 132 countries in the last 10 years.

Jun 23, 2015 (Cameroon Tribune/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Members of the China-Cameroon friendly group at the National Assembly yesterday June 22, 2015, visited the Confucius institute of the University of Yaounde II hosted by the International Relations Institute of Cameroon (IRIC). The visit provided the opportunity for the Parliamentary group to have an idea of how the Confucius institute functions as well as cultural sharing between Cameroonians studying the Chinese language and their mentors.

The MPs of the Group led by Hon. Gaston Koumba were drilled by a dance group of Chinese music and beats before being tutored briefly on the basic salutations in the Chinese language. Before the guided tour of the Institute, the Director of the Confucius institute, Yu Guoyang explained that the learning of Chinese language in Cameroon began in 1996 and in 2000 following the visit of the then Chinese President Hao Jin Tao, the Confucius institute was created in Yaounde. Since then, remarkable progress, he said, has been made in terms of the number of Cameroonians students who have studied Chinese language and scholarships awarded for further studies in China.

He said about 8,000 Cameroonians have been taught the Chinese language over the past years. There is a growing demand for the Chinese language reason why some 20 teaching centres of Chinese language have been created in the country. The visit was also characterised by a question and answer session between the MPs and the officials of the Confucius institute. The MPs expressed the need for Cameroonian local languages to also be taught in China as well as the need for subjects such as mathematics and technology to also be taught in the institute. The visit was also attended by the Director of IRIC.

 Nigerians teachers and students in the Southwest Lagos city were offered a "glutinous" taste of the Chinese culture as they cerebrated the Dragon Boat Festival here at the Confucius institute at the University of Lagos on Friday.

Up to 300 teachers and students from local primary and secondary schools and universities took part in the celebrations of the Dragon Boat Festival, or Duanwu Festival, which falls on June 20, Saturday, this year.

"The Chinese people have a tradition to race dragon boat in Duanwu, so we would like to take this occasion to introduce the Chinese culture to the local friends," said Jiang Lirong, a co- director at the institute.

The origins of the Dragon Boat Festival was on display on a projector machine in one of the classrooms to the visitors, as other attendees were entertained by a combination of traditional activities, including Dragon-Boat Corner, Chinese Experience Class, Chinese Message Wall and Time Travel Snapshot.

Guests were treated with Zongzi, a kind of sweet, glutinous rice dumplings.

Zongzi, a traditional Chinese food eaten during the Dragon Boat Festival, is made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo, reed, or other large flat leaves.

Gift items were also presented to participating teachers and students after answering quiz questions.

R. D. Cilliers, who is the principal of Grace School located at Gbagada area of Lagos, Nigeria's economic hub, said the Chinese language was introduced so that their students could learn more languages to facilitate communication and to have an added advantage.

He stressed the need for students to acquire additional skills, in addition to their educational qualifications, saying that language skill was important.

"I think it's important to learn it because China is a cultural and economic giant in today's world," he added.

Tunwase Ayomide, a student of Grace School who is schedule to visit China in June, said she has been studying Chinese because she wants to distinguish herself from other students.

"It has been interesting for me to learn from another language, I wanted a better understanding of Chinese culture because it has such a rich history," she told Xinhua.

The Duanwu Festival takes place on the fifth day of the fifth month in the Chinese lunar calendar.

Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet and politician in the Warring States Period (475 BC-221 BC) in Chinese history, drowned himself before his state fell to the invading enemy. Legend says that people went to retrieve his body from the river by sailing boats decorated as dragons in order to scare the fish away.

The Lagos Confucius institute was co-founded by Beijing Institute of Technology and Lagos University in May 2009 to provide Chinese language and culture education for Nigerians.

Cairo, May 26, 2015 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- "Could you please teach me how to speak this sentence in Chinese?" an Egyptian student asked politely, with a smile on her face.

It was a normal and busy day for the Egyptian students and Chinese teachers in the Confucius institute at Cairo University in Egypt. The first term of the ongoing academic year has just ended, and final exams and summer schools will soon begin.

"We are a little nervous about the exam because the pronunciation of Chinese is really difficult," said Aisha, a first-grade student of Cairo University majoring in Chinese.

Co-founded by the Cairo University and China's Peking University in 2008, the Confucius institute of Cairo University is located in the campus of Cairo University, attracting hundreds of Egyptian students every year, most of whom are in their university years.

So far, about 4,000 to 5,000 students have graduated from this Confucius institute, and that has helped to promote the popularity of the institute among young Egyptians.

"There is no restriction on enrollment; everyone can apply to learn Chinese from scratch here," said Xie Yinyan, a Chinese teacher who came to Cairo in 2013, noting that there will be about twenty classes this summer for 300 students. "We have to work hard this summer," she added, with high hopes.

"In recent years, the number of Chinese learning students has doubled, if not tripled. Even in 2013 and 2014, when the country was trapped in political chaos, that figure continued rising," she told Xinhua.

The Chinese professor mentioned that most students are Chinese majors from local Egyptian universities. They come to the institute, seeking help from native Chinese teachers to practice Chinese speaking and listening skills.

The institute also holds a number of different activities for the students, like photography contests and calligraphy competitions.

"I can learn traditional Chinese culture here, not only words and sentences. We have Chinese calligraphy, drawing and zither classes, which attract me so much," said Zainab, a 20-year-old girl.

"China is my dream, I dream of studying and living in China one day, and find my life there," she said.

All the Chinese teachers at the Institute are professors from various universities back in China. They all have at least three years of experience of teaching Chinese in different countries.

"After training for months in China, we are well prepared to introduce the Chinese culture around the world. We try to diversify the curriculum to make it more interesting for students," a Chinese teacher named Li Xinran told Xinhua.

She said Ms. Xie teaches Chinese zither and calligraphy while another teaches traditional Chinese dancing, adding that the Confucius Institution or the Chinese Cultural Center in Egypt hold lots of contests every year here, such as story telling contest, etc.

"The biggest event is a Chinese proficiency competition called 'the Chinese Bridge,' where the winner student in Egypt can go to China for the finals and may be provided a scholarship to study in Chinese universities," Li told Xinhua, adding that "for some students, it is a good channel to visit China and get opportunities to study abroad."

Thanks to the funding from Confucius institute headquarters - known also as Hanban - and Cairo University, the Chinese classes here provide students with more knowledge about China and more work choices in the future, as some students learn Chinese for job opportunities like being tourist guides or working for Chinese companies.

For most families, spending hundreds of Egyptian pounds to study Chinese in Confucius institute for one term (about three months) is expensive, but still affordable.

"The tuition fee cannot cover the cost, of course. We don't earn much money compared to the workloads. However, the work gives me a sense of cultural achievement," said Liu Hao, who has almost finished the three-year teaching in Egypt.

"I am always surprised by the students who can learn so fast; they are talented in learning Chinese," Liu added in an excited tone.

"We get along very well with Egyptians. Ms. Li has come to Egypt with her little son, who loves the kindergarten here," Liu told Xinhua, adding that "while we are trying to introduce China to our students, we have assimilated ourselves into Egypt."

Along with the Confucius institute of the Suez Canal University, the two Chinese institutes in Egypt have become a bridge for China to bring its language and culture in the most populous Arab country.

"I once introduced a Chinese song named 'On the Way' to the students in class and, surprisingly, they understood the lyrics so well and told me that they are on the way to a better life and a better country," She said.

AFRICA can learn from China's long march, from a feudal, undeveloped territory to the world's second-largest economy.

This emerged from the China-Africa colloquium at UCT this week, convened by the Centre for African Studies, the Institute for African Alternatives and the Confucius institute at UCT.

AU Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, China's Ambassador to South Africa Tian Xuejun, former president Kgalema Motlanthe, Professor Yin Hong Shi, counsellor to the Chinese state department, former parliamentarian Professor Ben Turok and UCT vice-chancellor Max Price were panellists assessing trade, diplomatic, security and cultural co-operation.

Price paid homage to Africa Month, noting the conference was convened on the eve of the anniversary of the Organisation of African Unity, founded in Ghana on May 25, 1963.

Price said growing relations between Africa and China signalled "the rise of two giants" buttressed by $200 million (R2.37 billion) of trade with Africa.

Tian said his country's involvement on the continent was "a dynamic factor of international relations" be-cause China was the world's largest developing country, while most developing countries were in Africa.

He said China's commit-ment to African Union development was underscored by its investments having grown to $30 billion, China having the largest contingent of international peacekeepers on the continent and its critical role in the recent Ebola pandemic.

Dlamini-Zuma noted that memorandums of understanding had been signed on highways, railways, aviation and industrialisation.

Kudumatse, May 19, 2015 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- A culture tour hosted by China's Confucius institute at the University of Botswana (CIUB) in the country's rural area received positive feedback.

CIUB on Tuesday presented Chinese activities to Dikgatlho Junior Secondary School in the village of Kudumatse in eastern Botswana, which marked the third stop of CIUB's week-long tour to rural villages.

Initiated in 2013, the tour is designed to introduce Chinese language and culture to the children in rural areas, and also to introduce the local students to China and the world outside.

The culture tour is an event where students can learn a lot, acting permanent secretary of the Ministry of Education and Skills Development Ndondo Koolese told Xinhua after the half-day event.

Koolese said Botswana people meet Chinese around but know very little about Chinese culture, adding that the programs are extremely rich in terms of culture exchanges and benefiting of students.

According to Chinese Ambassador to Botswana Zheng Zhuqiang, the culture tour in Botswana is a very successful and meaningful event. The tour has proved to be an important part of promoting Chinese culture and strengthening mutual understanding between the people of China and Botswana.

During the event, the Chinese embassy also donated books and footballs.

Acting dean of Faculty of Humanities in the University of Botswana Peter Sebina said during the event as the world is becoming smaller, students need to learn cultures and languages that will enable them to benefit and harness what other countries have to offer this country.

He said he is optimistic that efforts of CIUB will attract students to learn Chinese and its culture.

Head of the school J.O. Bartlett also said she is overwhelmed by the performance.

In Dikgatlho, the CIUB team presented various kinds of culture performance like Chinese Martial Arts and Taichi, Peking Opera, Yangko dance, sword dance and fashion show.

More than 600 students joined activities of Chinese class, Chinese song, paper-cutting, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese traditional games and chopstick competition with CIUB.

15-year-old student Ndinah Kawamanoka said the activities are valuable and she learns Chinese culture and language. Katlego Ditsele, 15, said it's her first time to see this kind of activities which helps her to know the culture of foreign countries.

CIUB began its Chinese culture tour in the border village of Mabule, located about 260 km southwest of the capital city of Gaborone.

It will visit Maitengwe and Mapoka in the northeast bordering Zimbabwe in the following days.

Temple University is starting a Confucius institute -- the first in Philadelphia -- focusing on the teaching of Chinese language and culture, officials announced Monday. The school will partner with China's Zhejiang Normal University, which will send two Chinese language professors here to teach in the institute, said Temple Provost Hai-Lung Dai. Each university will contribute in-kind services and personnel worth $150,000 to run the institute, which will start in July, Dai said. The institute -- the 106th in the United States -- will allow Temple to start a Chinese major and offer K-12 teacher certification in the Chinese language, Dai said. Though Temple is one of the region's largest suppliers of teachers, it has lacked that certification -- a concern Dai said he has heard from the community. Confucius institutes are partially funded by the Chinese government and have been controversial in some academic settings. The American Association of University Professors last summer urged universities not to create them unless they can guarantee academic freedom and "unilateral control" over all academic matters. "Confucius institutes function as an arm of the Chinese state and are allowed to ignore academic freedom," wrote the association's committee on academic freedom and tenure. "Their academic activities are under the supervision of Hanban, a Chinese state agency which is chaired by a member of the Politburo and the vice-premier of the People's Republic of China." Both Pennsylvania State University and the University of Chicago have discontinued the institutes in the last year. Penn State in October cited inconsistent goals with the Office of Chinese Languages Council International, known as the Hanban, and the ability and desire to run its own Asian studies department. The University of Chicago ended its institute after faculty complaints and other concerns. But many universities, including the University of Delaware, Rutgers and the University of Pittsburgh, continue to operate Confucius institutes. Dai, who grew up in Taiwan, said both he and Temple President Neil D. Theobald are aware of the controversy and will not allow any censorship. Faculty teaching at the institute will have the same rights and freedoms as all Temple faculty, Dai said. "I want to make it very clear, both President Theobald and I will uphold the academic freedom of our faculty," Dai said. The institute has been in the works for several years. "For our students, for business leaders and for the greater community, an important part of being prepared for today's globalized world is an understanding of China's vibrant language and culture," Theobald said in a statement. Louis Mangione, an associate professor in Temple's Department of Asian and Middle-Eastern Languages and Studies, has been appointed director of the center. Mangione, a Temple faculty member since 1985, has traveled to China 17 of the last 18 years to teach courses in language education and applied linguistics at Zhejiang Normal University, a 28,000-student school in the city of Jinhua in Zhejiang Province. Arthur Hochner, president of the faculty union at Temple, said both Mangione and his assistant are comfortable with the project, and that allays any concerns he has. But, he said, he will watch the development of the institute closely to make sure that academic freedom is upheld. "We have to see how it goes," he said. "I wouldn't criticize it before it gets started. That would be premature. He added: "I don't think our provost is going to be hoodwinked by the Chinese government."

MABULE, Botswana, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Confucius institute at the University of Botswana (CIUB) on Friday began its Chinese culture tour in a border village of southern Botswana.

The first stop of the week-long tour across the landlocked African country is Mariba Junior Secondary School in the village of Mabule, bordering South Africa to the north, located about 260 km southwest of the capital city of Gaborone.

Friday's activities started with self-introduction when both Botswana and Chinese members of CIUB introduced themselves in local language Setswana. More than 600 students of Mariba gave the visitors a warm welcome and rhythmic applauds which they called Mariba style.

Senior school staff of Mariba Motlasuping Tshweneetsile welcomed the visitors, saying Mabule is very far that once they have visitors they like to stay with them and share with them.

Director of CIUB Part Mgadla said CIUB which was established in 2009 is basically aimed to promote Chinese language and Chinese culture in Botswana, which is part of University of Botswana's internalization effort.

He told students it is better to prepare dealing with such an emerging economic power as China.

The CIUB team presented various kinds of culture performance like Chinese Martial Arts and Taichi, Peking Opera, Yangko dance, sword dance and fashion show.

Students of Mariba also joined activities of Chinese class, Chinese song, paper-cutting, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese traditional games and chopstick competition with CIUB.

A 13-years-old student Masego Legoiwa told Xinhua she likes the activities, especially chopstick competition and martial arts, adding that she wants to be able to perform such skills when she grows up.

CIUB will visit schools across the country, including rural areas like Sojwe in the central, Maitengwe and Mapoka in the northeast bordering Zimbabwe. Dikgatlho junior secondary school close to the border with South Africa in eastern Botswana is also included in the schedule.

Confucius institute is a non-profit public institution which aims to promote Chinese language and culture abroad.

Gannan Normal University (GNNU), one of two provincial normal universities in Jiangxi Province, China, on 4th April received a delegation of six Sierra Leoneans, including the information attache at the Sierra Leone Embassy in Beijing, John Baimba Sesay and five students (John Hinga Magay, Emmanuel Frederick Swaray, Ade Lamin Conteh-Haris, Lamrana Alieu Jalloh and Hinga Margai) reading Chinese language at Master's level, with support from the Confucius institute.

The visit, which ended yesterday 7th April, was aimed at enabling the team know more about the university and for the students to share their experiences since their arrival in China in September 2014 for their studies. GNNU, over a year ago, jointly worked with the University of Sierra Leone in establishing the Confucius institute at Fourah Bay College, which today is contributing to cultural and educational exchanges between Sierra Leone and China.

In his statement during a session with the delegation on 5th April, Deputy Vice Chancellor of Gannan Normal University, Professor Xiaoyun Qiu, paid tribute to the governments of Sierra Leone and China for their tremendous support towards the establishment of the Confucius institute in Sierra Leone, saying, "Our success in Sierra Leone is as a result of the support of the governments of the two countries and the University of Sierra Leone and Gannan Normal University."

Professor Qiu committed his university's readiness to always work with the University of Sierra Leone for more opportunities and especially towards the success of the Confucius institute in the country. He encouraged the students to work hard, whilst expressing optimism that they will greatly and positively contribute to their country's development. "You are the bridge in deepening the relationship between the two universities and the two countries," he said to the students.

The Deputy Vice Chancellor conveyed his university's congratulatory message to Ambassador Victor Bockarie Foh on his recent appointment as Sierra Leone's Vice President, referencing a visit he (Ambassador Foh) paid to the university few months prior to his appointment as Vice President.

In his statement, Professor Hande Liu, Program Director for Confucius institute and Head of the School of Foreign Languages at the University, said he was happy because of the successes scored in deepening the ties of friendship between Sierra Leone and the People's Republic of China through the Confucius institute.

John Baimba Sesay, Information Attache at the Sierra Leone Embassy in China, thanked GNNU for their support to Sierra Leone's human resource development, through opportunities giving to students. He acknowledged the efforts of GNNU in establishing the Confucius institute at Fourah Bay College, which he said "is lifting the bars of development cooperation between the two countries through cultural and educational exchanges".

Sierra Leone, according to envoy Sesay, was looking forward to more growth opportunities from China, whilst underscoring that the Asian giant's current support to Sierra Leone's human resource capacity development will go a long way in directing the country's development trajectory in all sectors in the coming years.

Speaking further, Sesay said given the growth of China today in world affairs, "learning the Chinese language is of great significance for students from the world over, but more so from a developing nation like Sierra Leone. We particularly look forward to an increase in the number of offers given to our students, and also to more exchange programs between the two countries".

On plans for the establishment of a regional office in Sierra Leone for the Confucius institute, Sesay said the country was extremely delighted that Fourah Bay College had taken that decision and was going in that direction.

He assured of Sierra Leone's continued support to the Confucius institute: "Our former Ambassador, H.E. Victor Bockarie Foh, who is now Sierra Leone's Vice President, had received incredible support for the Confucius institute and has always committed his willingness to support in whatever way, for its growth and continuity in our country."

Also attending the event were Professor Xuebin Chen, Vice Dean of the School of International Education; Mr. Xiaojian Mei, Program Coordinator for International Cooperation and Exchange Division; and Ms. Qiyuan Liu, Interpreter at the School of International Education, amongst others.

The establishment of the Confucius institute in a number of African countries is in line with the follow-up measures of the Forum of China-Africa Cooperation's (FOCAC) Fifth Ministerial Conference, geared towards promoting cultural exchanges and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and all African countries.

The comprehensive coverage on China in Africa in the March edition of the New African said it all. So much ink is spilled on the effects of China's engagement with Africa on the economic front, writes Sishuwa Sishuwa, and yet, very little is made of China's cultural impact, such as the rise of its Confucius schools on the continent and what they entail for Africans' sense of self-belief and identity.

The first thing that one sees these days upon entering the University of Zambia, is the massive construction of the soon to he completed Chinese Confucius institute. Apparently, also in the offing is a statue of Confucius, which may he erected at the entrance to the university to draw attention to the institute. The University of Zambia (UNZA) is located off one of the country's busiest motorways--the Great East Road--which runs from the international airport into the country's capital, Lusaka. No-one can miss UNZA on their first visit to Zambia.

The fact that the institute, named after a major icon of Chinese culture, is being erected so prominently at Zambia's oldest and most prestigious university reveals, on the one band, the long-term vision of its promoters and, on the other, a nation not vet attuned to how foreign cultural symbols naturalise power and influence, especially in instances where little has been done to create and celebrate local ones.

I am singling out Zambia, however, only to give context to the rise of Chinese Confucius schools across Africa. The creation of Chinese Confucius institutes, the strategic locations in which they are constructed, and the fact that they are set to operate within the premises of the top national educational institutions--seen on

a continental scale--gives serious food for thought.

However, not much noise is made about them. This silence comes against the unmasked aim of the Confucius institute being a tool of Chinese cultural exportation, and the fact that it will be ten years in December 2015 since the University of Nairobi in Kenya became Africa's first official recipient of this "gift". That this important subject has been neglected is perhaps unsurprising given that criticism of China's role in Africa has largely been driven by France, Britain and the United States of America, countries that have their own vested interests and equivalent institutions of cultural indoctrination in nearly all African nations. What this raises however is several issues: the question of who sets the continental agenda, the paucity of forward thin king African intellectual opinion on key debates bordering on the continent's fate, and the stifling of African agency on these matters.

The result is that within the highly problematic dominant discourse of development, Africa continues to be relegated to the bottom. Duty therefore falls on all to discuss, using pan-African platforms and media, the aims of these Chinese Confucius institutes and the threat they pose to African culture. Culture matters because it is the invisible thread that ties people together or separates them. Life as we know and live it--its day-to-day mundaneness--is in fact culture. The Confucius institute programme was founded in 2004 to promote Chinese culture on the international scene. It draws its values from the Communist Party of China and has seen its presence throughout the world surge to about 480 schools as of December 2014, representing nearly half of its target of 1,000 institutes by the year 2020. This rapid expansion within a short period has coincided with the steady rise of China as an emerging global superpower and reflects a long-term strategy aimed at securing the country's growing influence abroad and fashioning its cultural imprint into the world order.

Cultural habits

The founding of these centres also represents admission, perhaps learnt from the West, that economic and nuclear power alone do not go so far in terms of effective control of the world. To truly and fully control a people, the powers that be must also influence their cultural habits, their language and belief systems. This has been routinely referred to as soft power. This strategy of conquest has been previously deployed in Africa by France, Britain and the United States--expressed through the creation of enduring institutions of cultural dominance like Alliance Francaise, the British Council and the American Cultural Centre--with considerable success and a devastating effect on the African psyche, akin to what renowned African writers like Okot Bitek and Chinua Achebe wrote about regarding the colonial condition.

It is also quite telling that the Confucius institutes have been presented as "gifts" to Africa and as a way of "strengthening" Sino-Africa relations by making the latter understand China "better". What this means in effect is that by giving the "gift"--particularly a very visible one at that--the Chinese are replicating the approach of the British, French and Americans in the way they use the "development aid" gift.

It is not surprising that development aid arose in Africa just after the formal end of colonialism. In the short term, the Chinese use these institutes to mark their territory on the African landscape and this becomes a visible, symbolic marker of their power and presence on the continent in a way that is not as politically or socially sensitive as the creation of, say, military barracks or the Africom. A school also becomes a medium of propagating ways of seeing the world and it is an exceedingly effective way for a state to build and extend its cultural capital internationally.

In the long term, these "gifts" soften the general populace into paying "tribute" to those who become perceived as powerful benefactors. That they are being constructed on sites of national significance or in ways that dominate the landscape speaks to this long-term vision.

In other words, what many critics have termed Chinese imperialism, like all imperialisms, including its Western precursors, recognises that it must empty Africans of their independent human essence if it is to thrive and defeat existing patterns of social practices that inform locals' knowledge and understanding of the world, how they engage in that environment, and how they re-create and interact with it--be it through customs, moral norms, laws, beliefs, tastes, art or other forms of cultural expression.

Confucius schools are therefore nothing but China's vehicles for global dominance, effected in the cultural sphere through the promotion of the Chinese language, tastes, education, architecture, music, food, movies, beliefs, banks, dressing, art, history and lifestyle, to be continued until such a time that these would have supplanted existing cultural precepts and raised local agents who would become the defenders of the new imposed order themselves.

Culture is dynamic; it evolves at every epoch and with every generation, and therein lies its creativity but also its vulnerability.

It is creative because it is not static and, like life, it renews itself amidst changing socio-economic and political contexts. It is vulnerable because some cultures are being eroded and replaced with others, usually those that are more dominant. Whether or not Africa's new imperial suitor succeeds in its aims depends, in large part, on the resilience of the host cultures, the strength of the host economies, and the consciousness and agency of the host populations.

It is probably easy for cultures, like the American one and others, to resist or at least manage external influences. For African cultures, already beleaguered bv centuries of Western domination and operating within the imperial supremacist economic and social structures which make Africa fertile ground for neo-colonialism, the rise of Chinese Confucius schools poses several threats.

On a continent where the major cultural industries--film, television, music and food chains--are already dominated by Europe and America, the establishment of Chinese Confucius schools threatens to frustrate the continuing efforts to resuscitate Africans' sense of self-belief and identity, their confidence in themselves and the world around them, and to unify the continent in a way that is perhaps best captured bv the vision of the African Renaissance. Most importantly, a new, more subtle and dangerous form of colonialism, which, unlike the Western interventionism of the past, enjoys the consent of those on which it is preying, is quietly underway, and with deleterious consequences that will only become clear with time. The imperialism of the 21st century is cultural, soft, digital, less conflictual and effected in spheres where the West lacks the moral high ground to disparage China's actions. By infusing the institutes into existing national educational institutions, the Chinese are investing and securing the spread of their culture into the minds of Africa's leaders of tomorrow--in many areas--be it industry, academia and politics.

Language allows the consumption, internalisation and articulation of foreign ideas through various media (radio, television, books etc.) and the possibility of expanding relations across many places. Education, acquired through scholarships to China and through Confucius schools, captures the promising youth of Africa, implicates them in Chinese philosophies, material and ideological exchanges, and creates a moral indebtedness that is difficult to totally unpick. One possible outcome for this scenario is the production of a national leadership with a sense of alienation from its own settings and which may increasingly look East, seeking to imitate the master.

Subservience of African cultures

Other possible threats include the continued marginalisation of African languages, symbols and heroes and the resultant self-emasculation of the African identity and other worst forms of enslavement that have never before been experienced, the increased subservience of African cultures to foreign ones, the rise of Chinatowns on the African landscape, expressed through new export growth centres, and the preservation of Africa's position at the bottom of the global value chain. Combined with the already entrenched effects of American, British and French imperial presences on African culture, winning the ongoing cultural war that the Chinese have joined will be tough for Africa, requiring an ideological mind shift, a strong and enlightened national leadership and significant consensus. People would need to be willing to endure a period of upheaval.

Africa has many needs, but Chinese Confucius institutes, Alliances Francaise, America Cultural Centres, the British Council or any other foreign institution of cultural control, are not among them. What Africa needs and lacks are its own ideological schools to build capacity in the many areas where it has a deficit. What Africa needs is a serious discourse initiated and led by Africans themselves. A discourse that explains the continent's current position on the global stage, one that seeks to internally develop and define its own priorities and how to engage with the rest of the world--on its own terms.


African countries need to question the suitability of the neoliberal economic agenda or current approaches to economic and political development; they need to create narratives of nationhood through media that resonate on a very phenomenological level with the masses and which would need to be hopeful and tempered by a hard realism. They need to pull together and establish political organisations which represent wider social and national considerations, which have clear ideological visions, policies that are inward-looking, other than narrow sectional, class and ethnic interests.

Africa needs visionary leaders who effect strategies for broad-based societal change and plan beyond their constitutionally-prescribed presidential mandates; and they need educational systems that are anchored in the national visions and which ground learners in the national culture and way of thinking and prepare them on how to engage with the outside world. And if Africans must write their own history, it must be both in practice (defeating the forces that dehumanise them and destroy their symbols) and in the realm of ideas --capturing the centre stage as the subjects of history themselves--by writing and singing about their cultures, victories.

Renowned Kenyan literary giant Ngugi wa Thiong'o once wrote that, "our lives are a battlefield on which is fought a continuous war between the forces that are pledged to confirm our humanity and those determined to dismantle it; those who strive to build a protective wall around it, and those who wish to pull it down; those who seek to mould it and those committed to breaking it up; those who aim to open our eyes, to make us see the light and look to tomorrow and those who wish to lull us into closing our eyes".

The question is: when will Africa wake up and free itself from clinging on to the adopted false consciousness of an ideological worldview which legitimises the power and privilege of the very forces that are committed to dismantling it, and as Ngugi wa Thiong'o says, pulling down the emerging protective wall around it and lulling its inhabitants into closing their eyes so that, as they did before, they sleep again and condemn themselves further to the abyss? Could 25 May--Africa Liberation Day--be the day to reflect?

Many Kenyans thronged a Chinese stand at the Third Nairobi Cultural Festival to learn more about the Chinese culture during the international event held Sunday.

China was represented at the festival held at the National Museum of Kenya by the Confucius institute at the University of Nairobi during the event that attracted 15 countries and two international organizations.

Guo Hong from the Confucius institute led the staff in displaying Chinese traditional clothes, food, calligraphy, games, and masks among other exhibits.

"This is the first time China is taking part in the event, and we are in Kenya to teach people Chinese language and culture and let people know one another," Guo told Xinhua.

Peter Kimura, a visitor at the festival, said he came to the stand to learn more about the Asian nation's culture after reading in books about the diversity of Chinese culture. "As China and Kenya forge closer international relationship, it is important to learn some aspects of the Chinese culture," Kimura said.

The festival, conceived in 2013 by the Liaison Manager of Research Institute of Swahili Studies of Eastern Africa at the National Museums of Kenya, Munira Mohammed, in a bid to promote the Swahili culture at first and finally becomes an annual event.

"In 2013, we attracted nine countries, whereas in the second year 12 countries participated and come next year we anticipate the figure to soar," Mohammed told Xinhua.

Mohammed said the aim of this year's event is to unite the world through heritage and diversity of cultures.

Other countries that participated at the event included the United States, Switzerland, Somalia, Philippines, Mexico, Nigeria, Spain and Indonesia.

Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for Sports Culture and Arts, Hassan Wario, was welcomed at the Chinese stand by the choir from Confucius institute that received him with a Chinese rendition of "Karibu Kenya" (Welcome to Kenya).

Wario emphasized the importance culture plays in life and promised to make the event a bigger carnival next year.

"Food and music are part of culture," said Wario, adding one does not necessarily have to visit the respective countries to learn about other people's culture. "You can even learn some aspects of customs from a forum like this."

Nairobi, Mar 18, 2015 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Kenya's Ruth Njeri's scholarly prowess can be instantly recognized by acquaintances, yet the popular Chinese language teacher at the University of Nairobi's Confucius institute has a humble and friendly disposition.

The young Kenyan female is not only ambitious, but has a versatility that has made it possible for her to integrate easily with people from different cultures, creed and socio-economic strata.

During an interview with Xinhua on Friday at the University of Nairobi's Confucius institute, Njeri recounted sweet memories of a sojourn to China to pursue a lifelong dream.

"My first visit to China was in 2006 when I got an opportunity to participate in the Chinese bridge competition. A year later, I obtained a scholarship from Tianjin normal university to study Chinese language and culture," Njeri said.

During her four year stint in China, Njeri was exposed to new and exciting experiences that broadened her worldviews.

"At the University, I also engaged in extra-curricular activities like travelling to new destinations. I also watched so many television programs and participated in competitions," said Njeri.

Her audacious and versatile spirit won her many admirers in the university and adjacent communities.

Njeri had nurtured the dream of exploring the outside world since her formative age and a sojourn in China was a watershed moment.

Determined to prove doomsayers wrong, Njeri burnt the midnight oil to study the Chinese language and managed to master it within a short span.

Before she left for China, Njeri had interacted with many people who had different perception of the Middle Kingdom.

According to Njeri, Kenyans' understanding of China was limited due to geographical distance and a colonial legacy.

"The limited knowledge about China in my homeland triggered a desire to explore deeper during my stay there. I made so many friends in the university and the community who taught me the rich culture," Njeri told Xinhua.

Travelling in the provinces with Chinese friends broadened her understanding of an ancient civilization whose imprint is still felt across east Africa.

"I decided to immerse in Chinese way of life and some of the misconception about the country and its peoples vanished. Interactions with people from all walks of life made it possible to gain knowledge on China," said Njeri.

After proving her mettle during the undergraduate studies, Njeri was awarded a scholarship to study international politics at masters' level.

It was during her post graduate studies that she gained new confidence and courage to broaden her understanding of China, its people, culture, cuisine and system of politics.

"I spoke to scholars and eminent persons who enlightened me about Chinese rich culture and cohesive political system that has withstood internal and external fissures for decades," Njeri told Xinhua.

She revealed that during her post graduate studies, the desire to become a goodwill ambassador to promote Sino-Africa cultural understanding lingered.

Her popularity with students and faculty members at the university went notch higher thanks to a flexible and warm demeanor.

Njeri's adventurous spirit won her recognition from influential people who facilitated her participation in landmark events.

"In 2011 and 2013, I participated in the annual spring festival gala, a very important event watched by more than one billion people. Afterwards, I was invited by Ambassador's spouses in Beijing to be a master of ceremony during their events," Njeri disclosed to Xinhua.

She finally returned to Kenya in August 2014 having acquired vital skills that would be utilized to establish a bridge connecting two different cultures.

Immediately she landed in Kenya, Njeri was determined to use knowledge acquired in China to transform the lives of the country' s youth.

Currently stationed at the University of Nairobi's Confucius institute where she teaches mandarin, Njeri is optimistic that Sino-Africa cooperation in diverse fields will blossom for the long haul.

"It would be great and satisfying to witness lives of people being transformed through learning of different cultures and languages. China is a power to reckon with and here in Africa, we can learn vital lessons on its path to renaissance," said Njeri.

At the Confucius institute, Njeri has devoted her energies to enlighten Kenyan youth and adults about an ancient civilization.

She teaches mandarin to 50 students and staff members at the University of Nairobi.

Njeri's dedication to duty has increased appreciation of Chinese language and culture among Kenyan youth.

"Based on my personal experience, I have encouraged students to study Chinese language and dispel the myth that it is difficult. So far, I'm impressed by the students' progress," Njeri told Xinhua.

She plans to become a goodwill ambassador to promote Sino- Africa people to people exchanges.

"I would like to pursue cultural diplomacy to enhance understanding of close allies. My desire is to witness many Kenyans visiting China not just in the industrial hubs but also in archeological sites to gain new insight about the country," Njeri said.

She noted that African people who visit China return to the continent having gained rich knowledge about how the Asian giant accelerated industrial progress.

TANZANIANS are missing out on scholarship offered by China under the Confucius institute (CI), as there are very few candidates turning up for the chance to study in China. Co-Director of CI at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), Prof Henry Muzale, said this in the city on Saturday.

He said China offers five categories of scholarships both short and long term courses to study Chinese every year. "We may lose more scholarships as we do not have enough candidates," said Prof Muzale during the 2015 Karaoke Chinese Song Competition to cerebrate the Chinese Spring Festival.

He further explained that the scholarships range from one academic semester to a fouryear bachelor degree in China and that those studying at the Institute have the opportunity to attend a summer camp in the country. "The scholarship opportunities are open to young men and women to study in China," said Prof Muzale.

He said last year a total of 17 students from Tanzania took part in a summer camp in China, adding that the Institute will invite those interested in this year's Summer Camp.

The CI Director at UDSM, Prof Zhang Xiozhen, pointed out that the programmes at CI cover Basic Chinese language, Chinese listening skills, oral Chinese skills, Chinese songs, Taiji course, Chinese calligraphy and traditional Chinese painting.

"The goal of the Institute is to promote and teach Chinese language and culture around the world," she said. Last year, the CI, a nonprofit public institution offered a Chinese language course to about 30 staff of the Tanzania Airport Authority (TAA) so as to overcome language barriers in service delivery with Chinese passengers at airports.

 The Chinese School of Language and Culture (Confucius institute) organized on 21 February at the Asmara University compound a cultural show in connection with the Chinese New Year.

At the ceremony in which Mr. Semere Russom, Minister of Education, took part, MR. Qiu Xuejun, Ambassador of the PRC to Eritrea, explained on the strong relation that is existing between Eritrea and China , and that the Confucius institute would have significant contribution in strengthening the relations of the two countries.

Dr. Wang Xiaqua, Dean of the institute, on her part said that the Chinese Spring Festival is a family reunion during which families come together to celebrate the new year, and expressed satisfaction for Chinese national residing in Eritrea and Eritrean friends are coming together in this occasion to celebrate the Chinese new year together.

During the occasion students from the Confucius institute and Rakuba cultural troupe performed different songs in Chinese language depicting the occasion.

The Chinese School of Language and Culture has been officially established in 2013 under the auspices of the Eritrean National Commission for Higher Education.
537
On January 13 local time, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, accompanied by Foreign Minister Pierre Moukoko Mbonjo and Minister of Higher Education Jacques Fame Ndongo of Cameroon, visited the Confucius institute at the University of Yaounde II, receiving warm welcome from the teachers and students.

Wang Yi expressed that as a bridge, the Confucius institute has consistently spread the friendship between China and Africa. Chinese education is the key to the door for youths to understand China. Youths are the future of a country, and Cameroonian youths studying Chinese here lays a better foundation for their devotion to China-Cameroon friendship and their beautiful life in the future.

Wang Yi said that I just asked Foreign Minister Pierre Moukoko Mbonjo why so many Cameroonian youths are willing to study Chinese, and he told me that because China is a major country and their good friend. The words were very plain and also very sincere. I was happy and touched by the words and felt more a responsibility. We should step up our efforts to let Cameroon youths not only know that China is a major country, but also feel that China is a responsible and friendly major country which is willing to share weal and woe and advance hand in hand with African friends. We will not only make over 8000 Cameroonian youths who are studying Chinese know that China is a good friend, but also let more and more youths of various African countries consider China as a good friend which they can trust, rely on and open hearts to. Therefore, starting from me, every one of us should be supporter, builder and promoter of China-Africa friendship and make unremitting efforts toward this goal.

H.E. Edward Ssekandi, Vice President of the Republic of Uganda,

Prof. John Ddumba-Ssentamu, Vice-Chancellor, Makerere University,

Prof. Zhang Jing, President of the University Board, Xiangtan University,

Dear teachers and students,

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good evening! It is my great pleasure to attend the Launch Ceremony of the Confucius institute at Makerere University. On behalf of the Chinese Embassy, I would like to convey my sincere greetings and congratulations to all teachers and students at Makerere University, and express my heartfelt gratitude to all Ugandan and Chinese friends who spent so much efforts in the preparation of the establishment of Confucius institute in Uganda!

This evening, we are here to witness the first Confucius institute in Uganda, which is jointly built by Makerere Universty and Xiang Tan Universty. This is a historical moment in the history of China-Uganda bilateral relations. As you know, Confucius is a great thinker and educator who lived more than two thousand years ago in China and still respected and admired by Chinese nowadays. The teachings and values of Confucius is one of the most important sources of the great Chinese civilization and Chinese culture. Named after Confucius, the Institute not only symbolizes the distinctive Chinese culture, but also has the responsibility on enhancing cultural exchanges and people-to-people friendship. Since 2004, 471 Confucius institutes and 730 Confucius Classrooms have been established around world, with a total of more than 1 million students. The first Confucius institute in Africa was established in Nairobi, Kenya in 2005. 42 Confucius institutes have been established in 29 African countries by October, 2014, Confucius institutes have become an important bridge for African people to learn Chinese language and Chinese culture.

China-Africa trade volume is now around USD200billion, and the China-Uganda bilateral trade is about USD500million. The cooperation between China and Uganda in the field of trade, investment, etc. has been largely expanded in recent years. A lot of Chinese companies are engaged in infrastructure construction in Uganda, for instance, CCCC is now building the Entebbe-Kampala Expressway, Karuma and Isimba dam are being constructed by Sino-Hydro and CWE respectively. Chinese government provided financial support to the projects mentioned above. In addition, CNOOC is engaged in the oil industry in the Lake Albert, which also provided scholarship for some Ugandan students to study in China. With the fast development of China-Uganda, more and more Ugandans visit and study in China, and many Chinese choose Uganda as their destinations travel and investment. The demand for learning Chinese and understanding Chinese culture among Ugandans is increasing in recent years. The establishment of the Confucius institute at Makerere Universty will provide a great platform for local Ugandans to better understand Chinese culture.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

China is now the second largest economic power in the world, and Chinese products can be found in every part of the world. The success of the Chinese people has its root in the Chinese culture. The values we Chinese believe such as "no pay no gain", "harmony is precious", "respect for rituals and cultures" etc. can be found in every Chinese success story. When developing relations with Africa, Chinese government is now holding the principle of "sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith", which also comes from Chinese culture. As we Chinese people cherish our own culture and tradition, African people also preserve their culture very well. Some values we believe can also be found in African culture. For example, there is an African proverb which states that "The one who asks questions doesn't lose his way", while Chinese people believe that one has to be not ashamed of to ask and learn of his inferiors to become a real master. Many similar values exist in both Chinese and African cultures. I hope the Chinese teachers of Confucius institute at Makerere University shall not only teach Chinese language but also become cultural messengers for both Chinese and Ugandan people. When you teach Ugandans Chinese language, do not forget to learn Ugandan culture and introduce it to your Chinese friends in Uganda and China.

Makerere University is one of the most famous Universities in Africa, and many famous Ugandan and African leaders once studied here. Xiang Tan University is one of the best universities in China, and Xiang Tan is the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. I believe through the joint efforts of both universities, the Confucius institute at Makerere University will achieve great success in the future and become a milestone in the cultural exchange between our two countries.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The Christmas is coming, and I think Confucius institute at Marerere University is the best Christmas gift for everybody. On behalf of the Chinese Embassy in Uganda, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere greetings and best wishes to you and your families. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

The Chinese say that even a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.

At Makerere University at the weekend, another major step was taken with the formal opening of the Confucius institute, dedicated to the teaching of Mandarin, the language of the Chinese people.

This is an important development and more of us Ugandans need to embrace more languages than our mother tongues and English, the official language and medium of instruction. Languages, it has been said, are the key to the world; but not many of us have aggressively tried to acquire these keys with a view to unlocking the opportunities that the world throws our way from time to time.

Languages such as French, German, Kiswahili are being taught but in many schools, they are only taken by a few students. In an ever-more globalised world, parents and teachers need to encourage children to value languages as a matter of principle.

The Chinese language, in particular, should be interesting to Ugandans. China has just become the world's largest economy, overtaking the United States. And the Chinese presence in Africa has grown exponentially, with trade volumes growing from just $10bn to $200bn in fourteen years.

In Uganda, the Chinese seem to be everywhere - from retail and wholesale commerce, to buildings and infrastructural construction. Chinese imports to Uganda were worth around $540 million last year, although our exports to China were barely five per cent of that figure.

It is instructive that companies such as the telecoms giant MTN have put up billboards in Mandarin in Kampala. It may be premature to say - as some already have - that the future is Chinese; what is certain is that the Chinese will have a much bigger say about that future than they have had about the past.

With that will come opportunities; Mandarin - as well as other languages - does present keys to unlock such opportunities.
544
TANZANIANS have been urged to study Chinese language to ably tap the many opportunities that exist between the two friendly countries.

Tanzania Director at Confucius institute (CI), Henry Muzale, speaking at the Chinese Day in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, said learning Chinese language is a great platform to improve competitiveness in different sectors in the country, considering the fact that China is far away in terms of development.

"Many Chinese companies are coming in the country to invest, therefore this can be a great opportunity of procuring employment as well as improve competitiveness on the job market," said Prof Muzale.

He pointed out that the country is facing a challenge of having indigenous people who could teach Chinese language.

"All the teachers that exists are people coming from China, therefore their plans to introduce the subject at the ordinary level education like English language so that as the students move to higher learning they can be able to major in the subject," he said.

The Chinese Director of CI, Zhang Xiaozhen said that the objective of the Chinese Day is to meet Tanzania's growing need of understanding Chinese language, culture, technology, skills and to increase mutual understanding between the people of China and Tanzania.

"The Confucius institute aims at strengthening the relations between the people of China and those in Tanzania especially the students by facilitating cultural exchanges," she said.

However, Prof Zhang urged students and non-students to enrol at CI in order to learn Chinese language to strengthen the two countries relationships.

"The course also provides a basic knowledge of Chinese language to Tanzanian students who secure scholarships to study in China," Prof Zhang pointed.

University of Botswana (UB) authority said Friday the 5th anniversary of the founding of its Confucius institute (CIUB) is an important occasion in the university's history and people of Botswana.

Deputy vice-chancellor of UB Otlogetswe Totolo said during the anniversary ceremony learning Chinese language and culture contributes to and promotes the mutual understanding between people of Botswana and China.

The ceremony is a part of the 5th anniversary celebrations beginning on Monday. The celebrations include photo exhibition, Chinese movies display, Chinese song and poem competition and open Chinese classes.

Others include lectures under themes of achievements between China and Botswana since the establishment of diplomatic ties and traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese ideas towards life and health.

The institute, named after ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius, served as non-profit public institutions to help foreigners better understand China through language teaching and culture introduction in universities overseas. The first such institute was established in 2004.

Chinese ambassador to Botswana Zheng Zhuqiang said CIUB in the past 5 years played a significant role in boosting people-to- people exchange between China and Botswana and promoting mutual understanding and friendship of the two peoples.

CIUB was established under the memorandum of agreement between the University of Botswana and the partner university, Shanghai Normal University. Established in 2009, CIUB now has 12 teachers with 4,700 graduates.
546
UCD has applied for planning approval for a new Chinese temple-style building on campus, which will be home to the Confucius institute.

The government of China sponsors around 450 such institutes across the world. However, this is the first time that it has ever offered funding to help the construction of a building dedicated to the cultural programme.

The Chinese government has provided 3m to build the amazing structure on the south Dublin campus, an amount that has been matched by the Government of Ireland.

A spokesman said : "There are around 450 Confucius institutes around the world, but this is the first time the Chinese government has helped to fund a dedicated infrastructure."

A planning application has now been filed with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council for the construction of the structure on a 4,439sqm site, close to the university s engineering building and beside its new lake.

The structure will have dedicated seminar and lecture rooms as well as a large open space atrium area for cultural events.
547
The Asmara-based Chinese Confucius institute has marked its 10th founding anniversary. The head of the Institute, Dr. Wang Xiaohua, indicated that it conducts activities under the authority of the Eritrean National Board for Higher Education.

It is known that the Confucius institute operates in different parts of the world through 400 schools.
548
 An increasing number of Jordanians are now willing to learn the Chinese language, especially the youth, university students and the business community, as China has become the second biggest global economy, according to an Amman-based language institute.

Head of the Confucius institute in Amman, Araz Mahserjian, told Petra that due to the rising number of people wishing to learn Chinese, several schools in the Kingdom have started to teach the language as part of their curricula where it is a third language, while some universities and colleges have incorporated it into their majors.

Since it was established in 2009, the institute had graduated more than 1,200 students, who are fluent in Chinese in terms of writing, reading and conversation, pointing out that the institute also provides scholarships to many students to go to China to acquire a Bachelor degree at the expense of the Beijing government.

Some students say learning Chinese is very important to them since they believe the future of the world economy will be in Chinese hands and that mastering their language would largely have an impact on their businesses and the national economy.

 Respected Professor Samuel Agyei-Mensah, Provost of College of Humanities of the University of Ghana,

Respected Dr. Mei Meilian, Chinese Director of the Confucius institute of the University of Ghana,

Respected Dr. Dzahene-Quarshie, Ghanaian Director of the Confucius institute of the University of Ghana,

Faculty members and Students,

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Fellow Chinese,

Good morning! It is a great pleasure for me to be together with you all to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the first overseas Confucius institute. On behalf of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Ghana, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the Confucius institute Day celebration, and the sincere gratitude towards all the relevant departments and warm-hearted friends from all walks of life in Ghana for your support to the establishment and development of Confucius institute in Ghana. Chinese language teachers working in Confucius institute, volunteers and teachers sent by the Confucius institute Headquarters (Hanban), you have my deep respect.

Confucius institute is an education and cultural exchange organization set up by Hanban in all parts of the world to spread Chinese language teaching and Chinese culture. The first Confucius institute was established in Seoul, South Korea on November 21st, 2004. So far, in cooperation with 122 countries and regions, China has opened 457 Confucius institutes and 707 Confucius Classrooms, and now there are about 150 million foreigners learning Chinese around the world. Starting from scratch, Confucius institute has developed from a small to a large number with its education scale expanding and the quality of teaching improving day by day. It has made important contributions to meeting the needs of learning Chinese by people from all countries, and promoting the understanding and friendship between Chinese people and other peoples. Confucius institute is a manifesto of exchange and understanding, an advocating team of civilization and culture, a seeding machine of harmony and friendship. Today, all Confucius institutes over the world hold grand ceremony to celebrate the brilliant achievements made in the past decade.

The Confucius institute in the University of Ghana was established and officially inaugurated on May 22nd, 2013. It is the first of the kind in Ghana. In May of this year, with support and help from all sectors of the country, Confucius institute successfully hosted the 13th Chinese Bridge Competition Ghana Preliminaries. It is most inspiring that a student from the University of Ghana with the Chinese name Yi Xiu, who stood out in the preliminaries and represented Ghana to compete in the Chinese Bridge Competition Finals in Beijing, entered the top 10 list and finally won the second place among all the African students. This achievement fully displays the Chinese teaching quality of the Confucius institute and the University of Ghana, the professionalism and commitment of teachers and the valiant spirit of the students to rush ahead. There are also a number of highlights in the development of the Confucius institute. In a while, Professor Samuel Agyei-Mensah, Provost of College of Humanities of the University of Ghana and I will inaugurate the HSK (Chinese Proficiency Test) Center in Ghana together. From now on, Ghanaian students can apply for not only Chinese Government Scholarship, but for those Chinese language learners who pass the HSK they can also apply for scholarships and various training opportunities set up by Hanban. The Confucius institute in Ghana will also open Chinese language courses in elementary school affiliated to the University of Ghana and Ghana Language Institution to provide Ghanaian children the opportunity to experience Chinese culture from an early age.

The Confucius institute in the University of Ghana has made many achievements in its own capacity-building and the promotion of Chinese language teaching. Yet compared with many other sister institutes, Ghana Confucius institute is still in the beginning stage. I sincerely hope that Confucius institute will further deepen the solidarity and collaboration with all parties to constantly enhance its attraction and cohesion, strengthen the construction of the faculty team, make up a consummate long-term development plan, hold various quality activities, and strive to improve China-Ghana bilateral cultural exchanges.

Teachers and Students, Ladies and Gentlemen,

More than 2000 years ago, China's great thinker and educator, Confucius said, "Nothing is more difficult than knowing a man." If knowing a single person is such a difficult task, then to understand a country and a nation is even tougher. I have been working in Ghana for half a year, and have deeply realized the traditional friendship between China and Ghana dated far back, but at the same time, the two sides still have to make more efforts to strengthen the mutual understanding and cognition between the two peoples.

Language is the window to understanding a nation's culture. Chinese is one of the most beautiful languages in the world, and has played an important role in inheriting and spreading the Chinese civilization. To do well in Chinese learning needs teachers to instruct and dispel doubts for the students, as well as the students' enthusiasm and perseverance in learning. Confucius put forward the idea that "In educating people, I treat everyone the same", and held that all people in the world are entitled to the right of education. He also advocated that "teachers should be tireless in teaching, guide students patiently and systematically, and teach students in accordance with their aptitude". On the other hand, students should "draw inferences about other cases from one instance, gain new insights through reviewing old material", and strengthen both thinking and learning because "learning without thinking is labor lost while thinking without learning is perilous". Students should also learn a lot from people around as "when walking in the company of other men, there must be one I can learn something from". All these ideas of Confucius are still radiating with the light of truth, and will of course benefit your Chinese learning.

The Confucius institute inherits Confucius's education conception that "everyone is entitled to be educated", and opens its door to all friends who are interested in learning Chinese. Here, you can intensively experience the practice of Confucius' important ideas of "within the four seas all men are brothers", "harmony without conformity", "gentlemen should associate by means of literature and make use of the association to support humanity". Your language learning is bound to promote your understanding of Chinese traditional culture and the peaceful development road of China today.

China has a five thousand-year-old civilization, while Africa is a colorful pillar of human civilization. Cultural exchange is one of the three cornerstones of the new-type China-Africa strategic partnership. I've noticed that Ghana is also vigorously developing her national culture. You attach more importance to learning national languages and have made new achievements in protecting historical relics. Developing countries not only have a similar historical process and the same development tasks, but also face numerous opportunities and challenges in strengthening cultural consciousness and confidence. We would like to work with the Ghanaian side, learn from each other, and on the basis of inheriting our fine traditions and absorbing the essence of the whole human civilization, create culture which is characterized by both times and nationalities to win the respect and recognition of the world. Confucius institute belongs to China, but more importantly, it belongs to the world. It is this esteemed institute's destiny to write a brilliant chapter in the annals of promoting world peace and cultural diversity.

At last, I wish a full success of the Confucius institute Day celebration and a bright future for the Confucius institute of the University of Ghana!

EDUCATION Minister John Phiri has said the Government will this year start the construction of more than 4,000 bed spaces at the University of Zambia (UNZA).

This follows a directive by President Michael Sata in his speech to Parliament a fortnight ago to expedite the construction of infrastructure of universities in the country.

The minister said this in a speech read for him by UNZA Council chairperson Sherry Thole at the 10th anniversary of the Chinese Confucius institute at UNZA.

The President recently told Parliament that the Government had embarked on a programme to construct student hostels at UNZA, Copperbelt University, Mulugushi University and Evelyn Hone College.

"I, therefore, assure the acting vice-chancellor that the project to construct bed spaces will commence this year," Dr Phiri said.

The Government is expected to construct a total of 3,200 bed spaces at the Copperbelt University, 1,280 for Mulugushi University and 960 bed spaces at Evelyn Hone College.

The minister also called on the private sector to partner with UNZA in special projects.

Meanwhile, Dr Phiri said skills training was cardinal in the alleviation of unemployment in Zambia.

The minister said at the Industrial Training Centre (ITC) graduation ceremony in Lusaka on Friday that the Government was convinced that the only way to alleviate unemployment and poverty was through improved skills.

"It is for this reason that my Government is upgrading, renovating and supporting our training institutions in all the 10 provinces of Zambia," Dr Phiri said.

"The skills strategy that we have embarked on entails empowering both youths and the elderly to acquire skills that will enable them participate in various socio-economic activities."

ICT vice-board chairperson Sylvester Mashamba said the centre had so far introduced professional long-term courses in telecommunications, fibre optics and computer system engineering.

I am confident that this will enhance cooperation between the two countries" Christofides said.

Assistant Professor Wang Shenxian, speaking during the conference, referred to the important help provided by the Rector on the establishment of Confucius Institution at the University of Cyprus, which will bring the people of the two countries closer.

He announced that the official opening of the Institute will be on September 27, when the tenth anniversary of the Confucius institutes is celebrated.

The Confucius institute of the University of Liberia (UL) has sent four students to Shanghai in China to study Chinese Language and Culture for one year on a scholarship program provided by Hanban, Confucius institutes Headquarters in China. The beneficiaries of the scholarship include Mohamed Sesay and Peter D. Sumo of Liberia College, Morris George of the Business College and Archie M. Luo of Science College.

Speaking to the four students at his office on UL Main Campus on Friday, September 5, the day of the scholarship recipients' departure, the Director of the Confucius institute at the UL, Dr. Alpha Bah said the students were given the opportunity after the successfully passed the Chinese language exam level-3, calling on the students to be ambassadors of the institute, the University of Liberia, and the country - Liberia.

"Considering the situation we find ourselves in today, for another country to see a need to grant student visa to go to study in their country shows the importance attached to the program; take it, therefore, as an opportunity and make good use of it," Dr. Bath admonished the students. He encouraged the students to take their studies seriously as there are many chances ahead for desirous student wanting to specialize in the Chinese language and culture.

Dr. Bah said that an opportunity is there for any student who pass in the Chinese Language Exam Level 5 to enroll in the Chinese Language Mater Program automatically, adding you have made the first move and the institute is looking up to you to challenge the test (HSK Level 5) in time to come.

"Register for Chinese language and culture study at the UL and form part of this golden opportunity where students are given run trip ticket, accommodation, sound learning environment and allowances free of cost to the beneficiary," he called on other students.

Dr. Bah, who disclosed that his mission is to introduce the full degree program in Chinese language study at the University of Liberia said he is pleased with the level of cooperation between Hanban, the institute's headquarters in China and the UL Administration, expressing satisfaction over the willingness of the Chinese language enthusiasts enrolling at the institute to join the institute.

Speaking to this paper, each student expressed appreciations to the administration and staffers of the UL Confucius institute and promised to do their best and focus on the task ahead to win the confidence reposed in them. They called on fellow students to take the studies in Chinese language and culture study at UL seriously, considering what they called the urgent need for bilingual or multilingual in the ever changing world.

Addressing the students before their departure at the UL Main Campus, the Vice President for Planning and Institutional Development at the University, Dr. Walter T. Wiles asked the students to be prepared to accept the other culture they are going to work with during their studies. Dr. Wiles told the students that situations like what is unfolding in Liberia calls for anybody to take preventative measure. He also called on the students to be ambassadors of the university, asked them to be submissive and show appreciation for any assistance.

Meanwhile, Dr. Wiles has described the Chinese as true development partners, wanting to see Liberia among the rapidly developing nation around the world. Earlier the Administrative Assistant of the Confucius institute of UL, Dexter Sumo provides the statistic said the institute has sent five batches of students for one year study at Changshat University of Science and Technology and the present group of four students is the sixth, adding that 27 students in total have benefited from this scholarship.

The deal will include the construction of a new 140,000 sq ft building. The existing ten-storey block will also undergo renovations to modernise it.

Furthermore, the contract will lead to the creation of a new home for De Montfort University s Confucius institute. The facility celebrates Chinese culture and language, giving students a taste of Chinese life.

Demolition on the site started at the beginning of the year, and saw the destruction of some superfluous low rise structures. Construction on the project is expected to start over the coming weeks. The refurbishment project is estimated to complete by August next year, whilst the new build will take longer, finishing in November/December 2015.

The 2014 edition of the Night of Beijing held at Celebration Centre was a fully intense indulgence of the senses, as the capacity crowd has obviously come to expect from the event.

Hosted by celebrity Chinese television presenter Xu Chunni and Michael Mashakada an alumni of the Confucius institute at University of Zimbabwe, the whole show was one seamless flow of one great act after another.

It is difficult to zero in on any particular act as the outright crowd favourite, showing that it was a night if uninterrupted masterpieces.

First up was a Peking Opera titled "Gems of Jingju" and performed by Beijing Opera Theatre of Beijing and Beijing Dance and Opera Company.

Those unfamiliar with opera might not have particularly appreciated the singing but the glittering costumes and the dances transcend all cultural barriers.

The four acrobatic acts were all stunning.

The Pagoda of Bowls in which young girls and their male partners did a number of unbelievable human juggling acts during which the girls had bowls balanced on their heads or upturned feet left most people dazzled.

Three poignant acts were the rendition of the classic Pied Pipers' "Ruva Rangu" by Pipa & String Quartet, a group that presented a daring but wonderful marriage between traditional Chinese and Western music instruments.

Their masterful interpretation proved that love knows no language boundaries. The connection was reignited when the Confucius institute choir also did their version which incorporates Shona and Cantonese lyrics.

The College of Music choir reciprocated by belting a popular Chinese tune, albeit with a traditional Zimbabwean instrument expression, which got the Chinese in the audience singing along and clapping in surprised delight.

Patronage was mixed across many ethnicities.

Autumn, the all female dance group provided a sensuous experience as they depicted the emotions that a woman experiences in the presence of the beauty of nature in spring.

They proved that women need not prance about almost naked to be deemed worthy performing artists.

But if any act has to be declared the apex of a night of excellence, it would be the Spicy Sisters "Diabolos" with their innovative acrobatics with dumb bell yoyos.

The intricate juggling and the dancing feather headdresses left the audience gasping in undiluted delight.

The final act was a rendition of "Welcome to Beijing", the theme song of the 2006 Olympics hosted in that city.

It was performed by You Mu and Yang Chong with the rest of the artistes joining in for a fittingly spectacular closing.

Night of Beijing has become an annual highlight of artistic events in Harare.

Although the show runs over a very limited space of just about two hours, the result is awesome enough to leave patrons satiated for a while.

Although a year of anticipation for the next event may seem long, fortunately the organisers freely allowed cameras and patrons will have images to sustain them until the next event.

"Everything here is just magical. The exhibition of different aspects of Beijing leaves one just awestruck and as for the performances, I am just blown over. This is my second time and I brought my children because the entertainment here is clean," said Mabel Dzavanhu, a patron.

Nostalgia and delight were the reigning emotions for Chinese nationals domiciled in Zimbabwe:

"Somehow the night makes one belong. It is good to experience something from back home here in my second home which is Zimbabwe. I am personally not from Beijing and I may never have had the chance to see these acts there. So I feel honoured that our people value us enough to do this for us," summarised Hu Jin, a young Chinese man who says he has been in Zimbabwe for three years.

Tickets were pre-sold through all Chinese restaurants in Harare and the $20 000 raised will be split equally between Celebration Ministries International orphanage and the Tokwe Mukosi flood victims who are currently in Chingwizi Transit Camp.

Nepali Ambassador to China Mahesh Kumar Maskey inaugurated the Nepal Study Center at Hebei University of Economics and Business (HUEB) in Hebei, China on Wednesday.The center is the first academic institution specialising in Nepal study in China that will introduce Nepal's culture, education, politics and economics to Chinese students, and promote China-Nepal ties, the HUEB said in a statement.

The center is based on the foundation laid by the collaborative work of HUEB and Kathmandu University. It is mostly composed by teachers of HUEB who once worked at Confucius institute at Kathmandu University (CIKU).

"These teachers cherish China-Nepal friendship in their hearts, and concentrate on their studies and silently devote themselves to enabling Chinese people to understand the Nepal people better, furthering the development of China-Nepal relationship, making contribution to the construction of the comprehensive and cooperative generation-to- generation partnership between China and Nepal," read the statement.

The first overseas Confucius established in 2007, CIKU has been teaching Chinese language and culture to Nepali students. With the establishment of the Nepal Study Center, the Hebei University expects to teach the Chinese students the Nepali language and culture.

ABOUT 100 students are expected to attend a two-week 2014 Chinese Bridge Summer Camp to be held later in China in September, this year.

The University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM)-based Confucius institute (CI) Chinese Director, Zhang Xiaozhen, said this while opening a Martial Arts Performance, which is part of the 50th Anniversary Celebrations of China - Tanzania Diplomatic Relations, at Mbezi Beach High School in Dar es Salaam.

Zhang said that each year, at least 20 students are invited to a familiarization trip in China but following a directive by the Chinese Vice- President, Li Yuanchao, last month, the number will now be increased.

Opening a conference of Confucius institutes in Africa, Li ordered the number to be increased to 100. "During the tour the students will learn Chinese language, kungfu, choreography and visit historical sites in China," Zhang said.

She said that the aim of doing this is to meet Tanzania's growing need of understanding Chinese language, culture, technology and skills and to increase mutual understanding between the people of China and Tanzania.

"We want to expand the language skills in Tanzania by complementing it with other existing languages such as Kiswahili, English and to some extent French," she explained.

However, Zhang urged students to enrol at CI in order to learn Chinese language to strengthen the two countries relationships. On his part, the Deputy Headmaster of Mbezi Beach High School, Sijale Enosh, said that the school is honoured to get an opportunity for its students to be exposed to Chinese culture.

"Being our first time to collaborate with the Chinese we are looking forward to our students to learn a lot from them," he said. Enosh said that as a process of learning, students need to engage in recreational activities to refresh their minds.

CI was established at UDSM in January 2013, after the university signed an agreement with the institute's headquarters in Beijing, China.

The cooperative university in China is Zhejiang Normal University (ZNU) which is the first university in China to own the Institute of African Studies and the African museum.

Confucius institute at UDSM was launched on October 9, last year, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International and Cooperation, Bernard Membe, and Vice-Governor of Zhejiang Province, Huang Xuming. CI offers Chinese language short courses since the beginning of 2013/2014 academic year.

In the year 2014/2015, CI intends to introduce the General Chinese language as an optional course for UDSM students. In addition, CI also provides courses for pupils at Mlimani Primary School and Sunrise Primary School.

The Institute offers scholarships to Tanzanian students. Each year five categories of scholarships (2-year Master's degree in Chinese language, 1-year study, 4-year Bachelor's degree, one academic year or one semester language study) are offered.
563
Trustees of Canada s largest school board were given an opportunity to approve a controversial agreement with the Chinese government to offer students culture programs subsidized and controlled by Beijing.

Trustees of the Toronto District School Board were not informed regarding key aspects of the Confucius institute, as instructors are trained to self-censor topics that are politically taboo in China. The only information trustees received was contained in the sparse notes that could be found online.

Former TDSB chair Chris Bolton was the force behind the institute. He resigned, leaving trustees to deal with the fallout from the venture, including emails and phone calls from worried parents. Trustees passed a motion to delay the rollout of Mandarin courses to elementary students. The motion will give trustees time to gather information about the institute to determine the future of the TDSB s partnership with the Chinese government.

There is no explicit rule that agreements have to be approved by school-board trustees. But the secretive agreement with the Chinese government reflects the lack of openness at the board during Mr. Bolton s stewardship. It is difficult for trustees to answer to their constituents, when they have not been part of the decision making.

Bolton s successor, Mari Rutka, has vowed to break with the TDSB s past by making governance more transparent and by coming up with articulated policies on partnerships with foreign governments. The TDSB s Confucius institute agreement is an example of an area where the board can do a better job sharing information.

The Confucius institute at the University of Rwanda (Remera Campus) is like a small Chinese community imported to Kigali.

Situated past the university's College of Education main building, in neat simple structures set in the midst of tall trees, the institute teaches Chinese language and some aspects of Chinese culture to interested members of the public.

Set on 450 sq.km. of land, it hosts two classroom blocks, four office units, and a library that is more of a collection of some of the best writings from the country.

One of the book titles is; Common Knowledge About Chinese Culture, by an author whose identity I could not establish because the name is written in Chinese.

Next to it is a similar title; Common Knowledge About Chinese History, also by an author whose name is scribbled in Chinese.

I pick up a bright red book with the bold text: DICTIONARY, and Chinese inscriptions below it that I take to mean the same. Another inscription on it reads; "Kinyarwanda-English-Chinese, and in italics, Inkoranya y'Ikinyarwanda, Icyongereza n'Igishinwa.

The dictionary is jointly authored by Beatrice Yanzigiye, Kong Lingyuan, Cyprien Niyomugabo and Zeng Guangyu.

Currently, Yanzigiye holds the title of Local Director of the Confucius institute (Remera Campus), while Kong is its Chinese Director.

There are over 6,000 titles in the physical library, most of them by some of the country's renown philosophers dating back from the ages.

Teaching Chinese culture:

At the basketball courts across the lawns, a group of about eighteen young men are taking part in rigorous Kung-fu drills with a Chinese instructor.

They shift between pairing up for a tango, taking instructions, and making physical drills.

"With regard to Chinese culture, I love playing Badminton. I also practice kung-fu because our instructor used to tell us that it's one of the key aspects of the Chinese culture," says Protais Uwiringiyimana between drills. "One of kung-fu's benefits is to develop self-control instead of resorting immediately to force when you come across an unexpected problem."

Uwiringiyimana hopes to come out of the institute with a whole package - speaking, writing and listening skills, as well Martial Arts, which was his main interest when he joined the institute.

For Delphine Mukamurara, it was the sheer prospect of speaking Chinese:

"We started with a teacher called Zen Guangyu, then followed by a lady called Meng Huanfen. After her came Tao Ran. The first teacher taught us the Chinese sounds and pinyin - a system of transcribing the Chinese sounds into the Latin alphabet. He also helped us to create short dialogues among learners," she explains, adding; "At the moment we are being taught by Cheng Tao."

But challenges abound, in that learning Chinese is only for the tough of will:

"We have good teachers. However, Chinese pronunciation is very difficult. Writing Chinese characters is also another big challenge," says Grace Ingabire, a student at Gatsibo Community Model School.

All the classes are conducted in the evenings, from 6:00pm, to accommodate the schedules of both students and workers interested in the training.

"We have been introduced to Chinese culture through their language," says Dr. Beatrice Yanzigiye, the institute's local director. "This helps us communicate more effectively with the Chinese, either in class, at work, or other circumstances."

Kong Lingyuan, the Chinese Director came to work at the institute in January 2011.

That time, his mother had just undergone knee replacement surgery, which put him in a dilemma - on the one hand, his mother needed to be taken care of, and on the other, the new job posting awaited him. After several days of consideration, he decided to ask his brother to look after their mother on his behalf.

"I reported for work in Kigali before the Chinese traditional New Year when all members of the family are expected to be together."

Respect for other cultures important:

After a relatively short time in this position, it came to Kong's realisation that a few problems existed between the outgoing foreign director and her local counterpart.

"The former director didn't know how to liaise effectively with the natives. He was only interested in teaching Chinese to the natives, but was not interested in Kinyarwanda."

Challenges:

His view is that cross-cultural exchanges should be two-way: "The thing is, if you want other people to learn your culture, it is important to learn theirs first."

He adds that the Confucius institutes around the world are frontiers for spreading appreciation for Chinese culture around the world.

Still, challenges abound; like the fact that the Chinese language is yet to be incorporated into the national teaching curriculum.

As Yanzigiye puts it; "This has adverse effects in the sense that Chinese language students do not have many opportunities to put their lessons into practice. For this reason, so far, very few people apply to go to China."

Her wish is for more Chinese language teachers and teaching centers to be prioritized.

About the Confucius institute:

The Confucius institute at the University of Rwanda was opened in June 2009, after friendly negotiations between the Chongqing Normal University (CQNU) from China, and the then Kigali Institute of Education, now University of Rwanda (UR).

It is a non-profit organization that is primarily charged with promoting Chinese language and culture, and enhancing cultural and academic exchanges between Rwanda and China.

Since 2009, it has offered Chinese language classes to both students and staff at the University.

Besides the main branch at the UR campus in Remera, the institute has affiliate language and martial arts classes in five different locations across the country - Inyange Girls' School of Sciences, in Rulindo district, Northern Province; Gatsibo Model School (Eastern Province); Huye district in the Southern Province, Masaka Hospital in Kicukiro district and Umutara Polytechnic College.

Since the first Chinese class opened in April 2009, the number of students has been steadily rising - from the pioneer class of 209 students, the class boasted 2025 students by the last intake.

For pupils growing up in the global village, it is important to learn to communicate in the most widely spoken first language in the world, schools in KwaZulu-Natal say.

Kearsney College, one of few schools to offer Mandarin as part of its academic timetable, has welcomed a teacher from Beijing, Jing Wang, to its staff this month.

She joins the school as part of a partnership with the HanBan Confucius institute in Beijing and will be teaching Mandarin to 25 Grade 8 pupils this year.

Mandarin was first introduced at Kearsney College in 2005 for the choir, which was to travel to China. Since then, it has been offered to boys in grades 8 and 9.

Headmaster Elwyn van den Aardweg said the involvement of the Confucius institute built on that and took the lessons to a "superior" level.

"We strive for excellence at all levels - academically and extramurally - with a goal of empowering boys to reach their full potential and putting them in an unassailable position to contribute effectively to a global economy and society," Van den Aardweg said.

Wang, who arrived in South Africa three weeks ago, said her pupils already knew how to say, "Hello," "How are you?" and, "I'm from South Africa," in Mandarin.

"The boys are very smart and learn quickly," she said, adding that they seemed particularly interested in learning to write in the language.

New level

Wang said that by the end of the year her pupils should be able to have a basic conversation in Mandarin.

The HanBan Institute is affiliated to the Chinese Ministry of Education and promotes the Chinese language and culture.

Westville Boys' High has been teaching Mandarin at a conversational level for four years, also with the assistance of the HanBan Institute, and the lessons are compulsory for the Grade 8 pupils.

Gordon Road Girls has been offering the language for five years and it is an option for pupils in grades 4 to 7, once a week, after school.

The Basic Education Department is exploring having more public schools offer Mandarin.

"There are currently six Confucius Institutions in South Africa and, with the help of the Chinese government, a curriculum for the teaching of Chinese will be developed to be offered in some schools around the country," department spokesman, Elijah Mhlanga, said.

It is not long before I came to Ghana and assumed the office of Chinese Ambassador that I attend with great delight the Anniversary Celebration of the Confucius institute of the University of Ghana. On behalf of the Chinese Embassy, I would like to extend the warmest congratulations to the Confucius institute in Ghana for this event and most sincere gratitude towards all the relevant departments and warm-hearted friends of both the Chinese and Ghanaian sides. The Chinese teachers of Confucius institute and teachers sent by the National Office for Teaching Chinese and Foreign Language (NOCFL), you have my highest respect.

This morning I attended the Ghanaian preliminary contest of the 13th "Chinese Bridge" Competition. All competitors were high-spirited and did give an excellenct show. Their Chinese and their understanding of Chinese culture are beyond my imagination. The competition was very successful, and to all the students, congratulations!

I have something to share with all competitors and lovers of the Chinese language present today.

First, Chinese is one of the most beautiful languages in the world, therefore worthy of learning. Chinese character, the written form of the Chinese language, is the only one still in use today of the three ancient writing systems. It can be dated back to 8000 years ago. The Chinese calligraphy is art and a precious cultural heritage. The works of ancient Chinese calligraphers are very competitive products in the international art market. Every Chinese character is sound and meaning combined so that a single word or a very short sentence can mean a thousand things. The Book of Songs, the Songs of the Chu, the poetry of the Tang Dynasty, the verses of the Song Dynasty and the dramas of the Yuan Dynasty have both beautiful artistic conceptions and deep meanings. Leaders across the world have on many occasions quoted set phrases of Chinese idioms and classical allusions. The year before last, the well-renowned Chinese writer Mr. Mo Yan won the Nobel Literature Prize, which constitutes a new mark that the Chinese language and literature have been recognized by the world. Nowadays, more than 40 million people in the world are learning Chinese.

Second, the Chinese civilization is one of the most time-honored civilizations in the world, therefore worthy of studying. China boasts a history of over 5000 years. More than 2000 years ago, there were over 100 masters' schools with Confucius, Mencius and Mozi as the leading figures. They proposed an extensive and profound thinking system of the unity and interaction between the Heaven, the Earth and humanity. As the most outstanding master, Confucius was not only a thinker, but also a great politician. As a thinker, he founded the school of Confucianism, which becomes the backbone of the traditional Chinese culture. The Chinese civilization, in its process of development, has assimilated achievements of other outstanding civilizations in the world, but the Chinese value system is always marked by Confucianism, with the five virtues of "kindness, righteousness, propriety, wisdom and trustworthiness" passing from one generation to the next. As a politician, Confucius dreamed of building "a world of Datong", which means a harmonious world. China today has inherited and developed this concept, and proposed the path of peaceful development which features the strategy of mutually-beneficial win-win cooperation and the promotion of a harmonious world.

Third, China is one of the greatest countries in the world, therefore worthy of cognizing. Several thousand years before the Industrial Revolution, China had always ranked first in the fields of economy, science and culture in the world. Since the modern times, due to the corruption and ignorance of the feudal ruling class, China had subdued into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The founding of the New China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 turned a new page for the resilient endeavor of the Chinese nation. After over 30 years of Reform and Opening-up, China has achieved historic progress, with her economy ranking second largest in the world. However, we are fully aware that as a country with a population as large as 1.3 billion, no matter how big the aggregate of the economy is, China's per capita GDP is about the 80th in the world. Our road ahead is long before we can have all the 1.3 billion people enjoy a good life. Having sized up the present situation, the new leadership of China with Mr. Xi Jinping as the party general secretary proposed the great blueprint of the Chinese Dream for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the all-round strategy of deepening the Reform. With the steady promotion of the Chinese Dream and the in-depth development of the Reform, China will continue to see more changes and bring more new opportunities of development for the whole world.

Faculty Members, Students,

China regards Africa as a colorful polar of the human civilization. Cultural communication and interaction is one of the three pillars of the new type strategic partnership between China and Africa. A few days ago, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang completed his visit to four African countries. At the headquarters of the African Union, Premier Li proposed the new framework for China-Africa cooperation, of which one of the highlights is the promotion of cultural communication and cooperation with Africa. For this, the Chinese side has proposed several brand projects such as the "China-Africa Cultural Cooperation Partnership", the "China-Africa People-to-People Friendly Action". We will set up more Chinese Culture Centers and Confucius institutes in Africa to promote cooperation in science and education, strengthen professional training and help African countries improve their human resources. We will encourage more and more Chinese to take a trip to Africa and welcome more African friends to travel to China for sightseeing, studying and investing. Chinese Premier Li made up a vivid metaphor---economic cooperation and humanity communication are the two wheels to drive the China-Africa cooperation. Only when the two wheels are actuated together will the China-Africa cooperation enter the fast track, and the China-Africa cooperation have a brighter and broader future.

In recent years, China and Ghana have conducted excellent cooperation in humanity communication. At present, Ghana has the largest number of self-financed overseas students among African countries studying in China, and every year China offers Ghana a big number of scholarships for advance studies. The number of Ghanaian professionals trained in China ranks third among African countries. Last year saw the founding of Confucius institute in Ghana, the opening of a Chinese Books Window in the National Library of Ghana, the launch of the Brand "Joyous Spring Festival", the partnership will to humanity communication and cooperation reached between the Culture, Broadcasting and News Bureau of the Chinese City of Nanjing and the Department for Tourism and Culture of Ghana. All these have contributed much to boosting the humanity communication and cooperation between our two countries. But we should be fully aware that the potential for the humanity cooperation is still to be explored, and we should put more efforts into driving the "Wheel" of humanity cooperation faster and faster so that it would match the speed of the "Wheel" of economic cooperation.

Confucius institute is a bridge for Chinese people and people all over the world to exchange, communicate with and understand each other. Since the Confucius institute Program began in 2004, we have founded over 400 institutes in countries and regions of 5 continents. On its first anniversary, I sincerely hope the Confucius institute in Ghana would deliberate on the situation, sum up the experiences and make up a new work plan. We should continue to improve the Chinese teaching standard in Ghana, hold more colorful public activities, and strengthen exchange of experiences and sharing of resources. We should consolidate the cooperation base and blaze new trails so as to keep the momentum of the current craze for Mandarin and the "Sinomania", and make the humanity communication between China and Ghana even more heated. As the Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, I would make my personal contribution to this cause.

At last, I wish a full success of today's celebration and hope the development of the Confucius institute scale new heights!

So this agreement will solve those problems," he said. Dr Mkamwa said that instead of establishing the specialized University for foreigners, the visiting Chinese Universities chose to establish partnership with local universities like SAUT, adding already the Confucius institute has forged such partnership with the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) with the same mission.

Partnership with the Chinese Academic Institutions was not a new thing, said Dr Mkamwa, recalling another exemplary partnership with the Chinese Capital University of Economics and Business in 2012 SAUT with the same move.

"Nearly five days after Shari Baloch, the first female Baloch suicide bomber, blew herself up and killed three Chinese including the director of the Confucius institute, Shari was trending in Pakistan as #ShariTheLegend.

The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which had claimed responsibility for the daring attack, released a video message by Shari on Saturday night where she says that she took the decision to blow herself to achieve freedom for the Baloch nation. She shares her views about Pakistan and Balochistan, mentioning hatred against slavery, avenging the brutalities against the Baloch.

In the eight-minute video, Shari looks confident and emotional as she urges: ""We can do politics, lead protests, attain education, and sit on roads for the recovery of our loved ones, then we also can take part in this war of liberation for Balochistan"".

Talking about her personal life, Shari says: ""I lead a very happy and prosperous life. I have a job. There is no lack of anything in my life. I have two lovely children. But this is a path we have to take..."". She reinforces her message, saying: ""I don't need to do this as I have a prosperous life and two young children, but I am still taking this decision, and I have no regrets"".

The video shows Shari urging Baloch women to join the menfolk in the war of liberation. She thanks her colleagues in the Majeed Brigade for giving her the opportunity to become the first Baloch female suicide bomber.

The video ends with Shari's slogans--""Long Live Balochistan"", ""Long Live BLA"" and ""Long Live Majeed Brigade"".

Shari's suicide bombing against the Chinese has sent Baloch pride soaring. Despite the fact that Shari's attack is not in line with the secular trends in Balochistan liberation movement, it has been approved and accepted by the Baloch people for its daring and nationalist sentiment.

The Baloch community is naming its newborn daughters after the first Baloch fidayeen.

Shari's act has elicited support from other communities in Pakistan. Even the Sindh separatists have voiced their support for Shari Baloch and have been sharing her photographs and videos on Twitter. People in Sindh too have a long-running insurgency seeking separation from Pakistan. Some of the Sindhi organisations have links with Baloch groups.

Towards the end, the BLA video also shows Shari saying: ""They are coming"" as she points towards the van ferrying the Chinese academicians. She moves closer to the slowing van and detonates herself, killing three Chinese and the Pakistani driver of the van.

"
The new dynamic affects people as well as products. China is asking state firms to avoid travel to the U.S. and its allies. And if you were an American or Canadian tech company executive, would you travel to China right now, given that Canada has detained a leading Huawei executive (and daughter of the company鈥檚 CEO) for extradition to the U.S.? Meanwhile, many American universities are kicking their local Confucius institute off campus, most notably the University of Michigan, amid complaints that those institutes are spying on Chinese nationals who attend those schools. Whether or not that is true, this is another sign of the collapse of trust.
"Editor's note: Alex Chan is a PhD student in diplomacy at Peking University. Previously, he graduated in China studies from Peking University and international relations from the London School of Economics.

Chinese universities have experienced, during the past years, tremendous changes, which are reflected in international rankings. According to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), an increasing number of Chinese academic institutions are being included in the world's top 500 universities. If in 2008, there were around 30 universities from China in this ranking, 10 years later this number has doubled. Among which, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Zhejiang University and Fudan University remain the top four best academic institutions in the country.

There are many reasons to explain why universities in China have climbed so rapidly in international statistics. The country's ongoing reform and opening-up, facilitating the internationalization of its higher education, is certainly one of the main reasons. In fact, national policies targeted specifically the internationalization of Chinese higher education.

In the 13th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development (2016-2020), priorities were given to developing China's world-class universities and disciplines as well as to promoting international cooperation in the field of education.

This includes encouraging educational activities related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), implementing the study abroad action plan and ensuring that Confucius institutes run smoothly. According to the Confucius institute Headquarters, there are about 548 Confucius institutes operating in 154 countries and regions globally. They have been serving not only in bridging China with the world, but also in promoting the Chinese language, so that more and more people gain access to the culture and language of Confucius.

Globalization and China's open and welcoming attitudes towards academic exchanges are all important factors contributing to the internationalization of Chinese universities. The Chinese Government Scholarships, offered by the China Scholarship Council and entrusted by the Chinese Ministry of Education (MOE), play a crucial role in promoting mutual understanding, cooperation and exchanges between China and other countries.

Through the Chinese Government Scholarships, international students can undertake degree studies as bachelor, master or Ph.D. students in various fields. Besides the Chinese Governments Scholarships, international students can also apply for grants offered by local governments, Confucius institutes, universities as well as by the private sector.

According to statistics from MOE, in 2017 there were around 489,200 international students who came to China to pursue academic education, representing an increase of 10 percent for the second consecutive year. The number of students from countries along the BRI accounted for 64.85 percent of foreign students in China, up 11.58 percent over 2016 and a number that keeps rising as a result of increasing interests from these countries toward the initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013.

An example of the internationalization of Chinese higher education is certainly the establishment of the Yenching Academy of Peking University, one of the most important academic platforms for intercultural exchange and for exploring China's 鈥減ast, present, and future鈥?role vis-脿-vis globalization.

Tsinghua and Peking University are undoubtedly some of the most significant examples of Chinese academic excellence at home and overseas. Without China's commitment to reform and opening-up as well as open and inclusive initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, such progress may have been difficult to achieve.

While visiting Peking University in May last year, in occasion of its 120th Anniversary, President Xi reiterated the need to create world-class universities with Chinese characteristics. Scholarships for international students, the universities' inclusive and open attitudes, good government policies and the establishment of programs, are all extremely important for the internationalization of Chinese higher education.

"New Delhi, April 28: India on Thursday said its stance against all forms of terrorism anywhere has been steadfast and consistent and the blast at a campus in Karachi that killed three Chinese nationals underlines the need for all the countries to take 鈥渦ndifferentiated position against terrorism鈥?

鈥淥ur stance against all forms of terrorism has been consistent鈥?condemning it. This particular incident only underlines the need for all the countries to take an undifferentiated position against terrorism,鈥?Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during the weekly media briefing.

He was answering a query about a vehicle explosion on Tuesday afternoon near Confucius institute 鈥?a Chinese language teaching centre in Karachi University 鈥?in which four people including three Chinese nationals were killed.

The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for this incident.

China has in the past blocked attempts by India and other countries at the UN to designate Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed鈥檚 chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.

Answering another query, Bagchi said Pakistan has no locus standi to comment on Prime Minister Narendra Modi鈥檚 visit to Jammu and Kashmir.

He was asked about Pakistan鈥檚 comment on the Prime Minister鈥檚 visit to Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday during which he unveiled a series of development projects. This was the Prime Minister鈥檚 first major visit to Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370.

Pakistan had also condemned the laying of foundation stones for the construction of the Rattle and Kwar Hydroelectric Projects (HEP) on the Chenab River, saying this was a contravention of the Indus Water Treaty. (Agencies)"
"Harsha Kakar

The 鈥榟igher than the mountains鈥?and 鈥榙eeper than the ocean鈥?ties between China and Pakistan are possibly losing momentum. There is no doubt that China continues to support Pak diplomatically, as it did when it blocked Abdul Rehman Makki from being listed as a global terrorist, while simultaneously campaigning for Pak to be removed from the FATF Grey List. It also financially supported Pak by rescheduling its USD 4.2 Billion debt and promising to provide a USD 2.3 Billion deposit in Pak banks to boost its foreign exchange reserves.

The reality is that China has no option. If it did not support Pak financially, Pakistan could go the Sri Lanka way and default on its payments, most of which are due to China. Compelled by circumstances, China is pushing good money after bad. Pakistan鈥檚 failure to invest its share in the CPEC has slowed down most projects.

Diplomatically, ties between the two are sinking. Shehbaz Sharif, as the PM, has yet to be invited to visit Beijing, while his foreign minister, Bilawal Bhutto and army chief visited the country, albeit for different reasons.In addition, Yang Jiechi, a senior Chinese diplomat visited Islamabad to convey a strong message from Beijing. Officially Pak claims delay in Shehbaz鈥檚 visit being on account of COVID, but with Xi having visited Hong Kong and Xinjiang, this story has no value.

The cause for deterioration in ties are immense. First and foremost are attacks on Chinese citizens in Pakistan. The killing of three Chinese teachers of Karachi University鈥檚 Confucius institute by the Baloch Freedom Fighters in a suicide attack was the latest. An earlier attack on Chinese engineers working in the Dasu hydroelectric power plant resulted in Pak paying USD 11.6 million in compensation. While Pakistan claims to have arrested the mastermind of the Karachi attack, China is still not satisfied. The number of Chinese who left Pakistan after the attack displays insecurity.Pakistan will be compelled to pay compensation for those killed in Karachi once China determines the figures.

General Bajwa rushed to Beijing to cool tempers, which only worked partially. China demanded that it be permitted to employ its own security agencies to safeguard its nationals in Pakistan. While this would be a win-win for China, as it would set into motion an excuse for subsequent deployment of the PLA, it would be the opposite for Pakistan. Pakistan鈥檚 relations with the west are already tenuous, deployment of Chinese troops would only make it worse. It would also project Pakistan鈥檚 incapability insecuring foreigners in its own country. Till this is resolved, Chinese projects have slowed down.

Secondly, has been the problem with Chinese power companies, established as part of the CPEC. These companies have been regularly threatening to shut down power plants in Pakistan unless their dues,amounting to Rs 300 billion, are cleared. They have also protested on high cost of import of coal. To offset their problems, Pakistan made partial payments and announced plans to procure coal from Afghanistan at lower rates as also payable in Pak rupees. Exploiting the situation, the Taliban government increased the price of coal from USD 90 per tonne to USD 200 per tonne. They justified this on grounds of increase in global prices. Chinese power firms threatened to stop imports. The issue has yet to be resolved. A Pak official delegation is earmarked to visit Kabul to resolve the issue.

Thirdly, is the role of the IMF. The IMF, from whom Pak has obtained a loan, has objected to payments to Chinese power companies. On the contrary, it has directed the Pak government to renegotiate terms and conditions with Chinese power companies and bring their financial compensation at par with other power providers. This has angered China. Further, the IMF is concerned that Pakistan would use their loans to repay debts to China. It was only after obtaining guarantees from Pak did the IMF agree to release the next tranche of the loan.

Fifthly, Indian pressures. In the last BRICS online summit, India blocked the participation of Pakistan in the 鈥楬igh level Dialogue on Global Development鈥?organized on the side lines of the summit. It was attended by two dozen countries including Ethiopia, Iran, Fiji, Algeria, Cambodia etc. India鈥檚 reason was that Pakistan does not fit into the group as an emerging market was just an excuse. China, possibly due to dissatisfaction with Pak, supported the Indian stand, hurting Pak sentiments. The only comment which flowed from China was that nations were selected based on 鈥榗onsultation amongst BRICS members.鈥?Pakistan satisfied its population by blaming India. It is aware of reality.

Sixthly, poor quality Chinese military products. Reports indicate that the Pak armed forces are unhappy with Chinese equipment supplied to them. Armour, artillery and air defence equipment have been facing servicing problems, while spares remain in short supply. Problems faced by the navy and air force in their latest acquisitions are even greater. With Pak on the Grey List, there have been no weapon nor technology inflows from the west. Therefore it desperately seeks to get off the Grey List and shed its overdependence on China. It is aware that it is compelled to bank on China as other sources have dried up.

For Pakistan, the only saving grace is that China is slowly being pushed into the corner. It desperately needs allies. Further, with vast Chinese investments in the country and the CPEC being the bulwark of the BRI, China fears its failure. Despite all differences, China can never let Pak collapse and follow the Sri Lankan route. If that happens, Chinese global standing will be impacted. However, it will seek its pound of flesh, which could imply Pak surrendering territory including part of Gilgit Baltistan as payment or permitting Chinese security companies to enter Pak.

Pakistan also has limited options. It has only China for diplomatic support in global forums to counter the western backing for India. The fact that Shehbaz, whose second foreign trip should have been China, as is customary, is still awaiting an invitation, implies that relations between the two-iron brothers appears to be deteriorating.

"China on Wednesday asked Pakistan to scale-up security for its nationals working in the country and demanded a thorough investigation and punishment to the perpetrators behind the suicide attack at the Karachi University which killed three Chinese teachers and injured another.

The blood of the Chinese cannot be shed in vain, and those behind this incident will surely pay the price, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said while strongly condemning the latest attack on Chinese nationals working in Pakistan.

An explosion triggered by a burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber ripped through a shuttle passenger van of the Confucius institute at the prestigious University of Karachi on Tuesday, leaving three Chinese teachers dead and one injured and causing several Pakistani casualties, in the latest targeted attack against Chinese citizens in Pakistan's financial capital.

China expressed its ""strong condemnation and great indignation"" at the attack, as well as deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the injured and the bereaved families, the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the spokesperson as saying.

Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Jianghao has made an urgent phone call to the Pakistani Ambassador to China to express extremely grave concern, the report said.

Wu demanded that the Pakistani side should immediately conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, apprehend and punish the perpetrators to the full extent of the law, and take all possible measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in Pakistan and prevent such incidents from happening again, the spokesperson said.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Chinese diplomatic missions in Pakistan will continue to urge relevant Pakistani departments to handle properly the follow-up matters of those killed, treat the injured, and resolutely crack down on the terrorist organisation involved, the spokesperson said.

The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) linked Majeed Brigade has claimed responsibility for the attack that took place near China-built Confucius institute -- a non-profit institute teaching Chinese language to local pupils -- in Karachi University.

A spokesperson for the university said that three of the victims were Chinese nationals. They were identified as Confucius institute Director Huang Guiping, Ding Mupeng, Chen Sa and Khalid, the Pakistani driver.

The spokesperson added that two others -- Chinese national Wang Yuqing and a Pakistani man Hamid -- were injured in the blast.

CCTV footage of the attack showed a burqa-clad woman standing outside the entrance of the Confucius institute. The woman detonated herself just as the van neared the institute's entrance.

A spokesperson of the BLA, the separatist outfit which is banned in Pakistan, the UK and the US, said that the attack was carried out by Shari Baloch alias Bramsh - the ""first female suicide bomber of the brigade"". The attack marks ""a new chapter in the history of Baloch resistance,"" he added.

A picture of the bomber in circulation showed the woman along with her two small kids.

In a purported video issued by the group, a BLA spokesman said that the motive of the attack was very clear.

""It was a simple and clear message to China and Pakistan to withdraw immediately from Balochistan,"" said the masked spokesman surrounded by armed men on a hilly terrain.

""Baloch Liberation Army guarantees you the CPEC will fail miserably on Baloch land,"" the spokesman, who was holding an assault rifle, said in fluent English. He warned that a special unit has been formed particularly to attack Chinese officials and installations in Balochistan.

The group opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, especially in the restive Balochistan, saying local people do not benefit.

Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency. Baloch insurgent groups have previously carried out several attacks targeting the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.

This is not the first-time Chinese nationals have been the target of terror attacks in Karachi, which is Pakistan's biggest city and economic hub.

In July last year, masked armed men on a motorcycle opened fire on a vehicle carrying two Chinese nationals in Karachi in which one of them was critically wounded.

In the same month, nearly a dozen Chinese engineers were killed when a bus carrying construction workers was ""attacked"" in northwest Pakistan.

In November 2018, Baloch militants had attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi but failed to break through the security barrier with three of them killed on the spot.

Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on a host of projects being carried out under the aegis of the CPEC."
"China and Pakistan have agreed to step up their defence and counter-terrorism cooperation amidst ""challenging times"", as Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa held wide-ranging talks with the Chinese military leadership to further cement their all-weather strategic partnership.

Gen Bajwa, accompanied by top Pakistani defence officials, held talks with the Chinese team led by Vice Chairman Central Military Commission General Zhang Youxia in Qingdao, the capital city of east China's Shandong province on Sunday.

The tri-service military delegation of Pakistan visited China from June 9 to 12 where it held wide-ranging discussions with senior officials of the Chinese military and other government departments, according to a statement by the Pakistan Army.

The Apex Meeting was held on Sunday where the Pakistani side was headed by Gen Bajwa, while the Chinese side was led by General Zhang.

""Both sides discussed their perspectives on the international and regional security situation, and expressed satisfaction on defence cooperation between the two countries,鈥?according to the statement.

""Pakistan and China reaffirmed their strategic partnership in challenging times and agreed to continue the regular exchange of perspectives on issues of mutual interest. Both sides also vowed to enhance their training, technology and counterterrorism cooperation at the tri-service level,"" it added.

""China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners,"" said Gen Zhang, noting that over the years, both sides have kept close coordination and firmly supported each other on issues concerning each other's core interests.

During the talks, Gen. Zhang said China is willing to strengthen communication, reinforce cooperation, deepen pragmatic exchanges with Pakistan, and properly deal with the complicated factors in the regional situation, so as to push the military-to-military relations for further development, the Chinese military said in a statement.

In the meeting, both sides strongly condemned the terrorist attack on the shuttle van of the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi in Pakistan in April and stressed that any attempt to undermine the China-Pakistan friendship is doomed to fail, the statement said.

Three Chinese teachers were killed when an explosion triggered by a burqa-clad woman suicide bomber from the Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) ripped through a van of the Confucius institute at the prestigious University of Karachi on April 26.

The separatist BLA said it opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan's resource-rich Balochistan province, saying locals do not benefit.

The BLA has targeted Chinese nationals on a number of occasions, as has the Pakistani Taliban.

China is heavily involved in large infrastructure projects across Pakistan, including in the Balochistan province.

Gen Bajwa said that the Pakistan-China friendship is unbreakable and rock-solid. Pakistan will stand firmly with China at any time, no matter how the international and regional situation changes.

He stressed that Pakistan is ready to enhance dialogue and coordination with the Chinese military, carry out mutually beneficial cooperation, crack down on the terrorist forces, strive to improve the capabilities of both sides in dealing with various security challenges, safeguard the common interests of two countries, and make contributions to regional peace.

The visit was part of the Pak-China Joint Military Cooperation Committee (PCJMCC) - its apex committee is the highest military cooperation body.

The committee has two sub committees that include Joint Cooperation Military Affairs (JCMA) and Joint Cooperation Military Equipment & Training (JCMET).

Relations between the two countries have grown steadily in all fields despite concerns by the West regarding China's growing influence in the region.

Pakistan relies on China for military equipment and recently Beijing provided J-10 fighter jets to counterbalance the strategic edge India gained after buying Rafale jets from France.

Their multifaceted cooperation has gained more importance in the context of fast-changing regional situations."
"A burqa-clad woman suicide bomber struck a van inside the premises of the University of Karachi in Pakistan鈥檚 financial capital, killing three Chinese nationals and their local driver, in what is believed be the latest targeted attack against Chinese citizens.

The banned Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack that took place near China-built Confucius institute 鈥?a non-profit institute teaching Chinese language to local pupils 鈥?in the university.

A spokesperson for the university said that three of the victims were Chinese nationals. They were identified as Confucius institute Director Huang Guiping, Ding Mupeng, Chen Sa and Khalid, the Pakistani driver. CCTV footage showed a burqa-clad woman standing outside the entrance of the institute."
"China plans to ""optimise"" the spread of its controversial Confucius institutes, the government said, institutions to promote Chinese language and culture that have been criticised by some for spreading Communist Party influence. In 2004, China began setting up the government-run bodies, whose stated mission is to satisfy soaring global demand to learn Chinese.

But they have drawn criticism, especially in the United States, for being little more than a propaganda arm of the ruling Communist Party, assertions denied by both the institutes and the government. The Confucius institute will remain a key government policy, a document on modernising China's education system issued late on Saturday by the party's Central Committee and the cabinet shown.

""Optimise the regional distribution of the Confucius institute, strengthen its abilities and building, and fully raise its educational standards,"" they said in the statement, released by the official Xinhua news agency late on Saturday. ""Strengthen work on the teaching of Chinese internationally,"" they added, without giving details.

Such broad statements are typically followed weeks or even months later by more detailed policy documents that focus on implementation. Some U.S. legislators, including Florida Senator Macro Rubio, have been critical of the more than 100 Confucius institutes hosted at universities across the United States, calling them a vehicle of Chinese influence on international higher education.

Some major U.S. colleges, including Pennsylvania State University and the University of Chicago, have cut ties with the institute after professors complained its programmes were Chinese propaganda wrapped in culture and language education. The document added that China would improve educational opportunities for students from countries in the Belt and Road initiative, speeding up the grooming of international talent and helping foreign students return home to better job prospects.

China opened its first so-called Silk Road School last year in Suzhou in the eastern province of Jiangsu. About 100 students from countries in the initiative received scholarships as they study China's economy, politics, law and culture. Students from Belt and Road countries such as Pakistan and Nepal are also eligible for scholarships to other universities in China.

The Belt and Road initiative, championed by President Xi Jinping, aims to link China by sea and land with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through an infrastructure network on the lines of the old Silk Road. Aside from boosting trade and investment, Xi aims to boost exchanges in areas such as science, technology, culture and education.

"A woman suicide bomber who killed three Chinese teachers in Pakistan was a teacher who had enrolled for a master's degree months before her attack, carried out on behalf of separatist insurgents, a Pakistani official said on Wednesday. The blast detonated by the 30-year-old woman on Tuesday blew up a minivan outside Karachi University's Confucius institute, a Chinese language and cultural centre, killing her, the three Chinese teachers and a Pakistani driver.

It was the first major attack this year against nationals of long-time ally China working in Pakistan, and it drew Beijing's condemnation. A separatist group, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) based in the southwestern province of Balochistan, said the mother of two, who held a graduate degree in zoology and was studying for another, had volunteered for the attack targeting China, whose investment projects in Balochistan they oppose.

""Baloch Liberation Army once again warns China to immediately halt its exploitation projects ... Otherwise our future attacks will be even harsher,"" the BLA said in an email. Baloch separatist guerrillas have been fighting for a greater share of their province's natural resources for decades, mostly focusing attacks on natural gas projects, infrastructure and the security forces.

But in recent years they have attacked Chinese projects and workers. Balochistan and its deep-water port in Gwadar are a major link in China's Belt and Road network of infrastructure and energy projects stretching to the Middle East and beyond. For years, suicide bombing in Pakistan have been a tactic of Islamist militants, usually carried out by men or boys. The Baloch separatists said this was their first suicide attack by a woman and warned of more.

The threat of suicide attacks by the BLA will be a major worry for Pakistan as it tries to reassure China it is doing everything it can to protect its projects and people. China's Foreign Ministry has strongly condemned the attack and demanded Pakistan punish the perpetrators and prevent such incidents happening again.

A Pakistan interior ministry official who declined to be identified said the woman, a science teacher from Balochistan, had signed up for a second master's degree at Karachi University about five months ago. An investigation had been launched by police and civilian and military intelligence agencies, the official said.

The acting vice chancellor of Karachi University, Nasira Khatoon, expressed ""heartfelt condolences"" to the families of the blast victims and said the campus would remain closed on Wednesday. ""We hope that the government will punish the elements involved ... and believe that every possible step will be taken to reach the elements behind the attack,"" she said.

"Pakistani investigators probing the suicide attack by a woman at the Karachi University that killed three Chinese teachers have not ruled out the presence of more female suicide bombers at sleeper cells of the outlawed Baluchistan Liberation Army, even as police in Lahore have arrested a suspect from Punjab University in connection with the bombing.

On Tuesday, an explosion triggered by a burqa-clad woman suicide bomber from the Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) ripped through a van of the Confucius institute at the prestigious University of Karachi, leaving three Chinese teachers dead and one injured, in the latest targeted attack against Chinese citizens in Pakistan.

Following the incident, the banned BLA took to social media to claim responsibility and announce that the bomber was a woman named Shaari Baloch who was highly educated mother of two young children, belonging to a well-established family and working as a school teacher in her native Turbat, Balochistan.

The Anti-Terrorism Department of the Sindh Police also identified the bomber who was born in Turbat in 1991 but settled in Kech district of the restive Baluchistan province.

""Initial investigations confirmed she was part of the banned Majeed brigade, a part of the BLA which has brainwashed these suicide bombers,"" an official of the Anti-Terrorism Department said.

""We are looking into possiblities that there might be more female suicide bombers brainwashed to become part of the Majeed Brigade and waiting in sleeper cells,'' he said.

He confirmed that initial investigations had shown that Shari Baloch did not carry out the attack independently and was guided and helped by her handlers/facilitators, including a woman who met her at the entrance of the university and apparently briefed her before she went to the entrance of the Confucius institute where she detonated herself as soon as the coaster van carrying the Chinese academics came.

""We suspect this operation was carried out with inside information,"" the official said.

On Wednesday, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab Police have arrested a suspect from Lahore's Punjab University in connection with the suicide bombing at the Karachi University.

The intelligence agencies tracked down a suspect with whom Shari Baloch remained in contact by cellphone in Lahore and arrested him during a raid at a hostel of the Punjab University, a source in CTD told PTI on Thursday.

The suspect has been identified as Bebagr Imdad, a student of the seventh semester of English Literature in Numl, Islamabad. He also belongs to the area where Shaari Baloch lived.

''The agencies are picking up all those who remained in contact with Shaari before she blew herself up and Bebagr was one of them,'' he said.

A Punjab University spokesperson Khurram Shahzad told PTI that Bebagr had come to Lahore two days ago from Islamabad. ''On Tuesday, he visited his cousin at hostel 7 who is a history department student. On Wednesday, a security agency official approached the varsity administration and told it that it needed to take Bebagr into custody for his alleged link with the Karachi University bombing. The Punjab University obliged the request and now he is being interrogated,'' Shehzad said.

Some 300 students from Balochistan are currently studying at the Punjab University.

The security agencies are now searching for the husband of Shari Baloch, Dr Haibatan, who was apparently doing a public health course at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) and was staying at a nearby hotel. However, his wife lived in Gulistan-i-Jauhar with her two children.

Counter-Terrorism Department official Raja Umar Khatab said that Shari Baloch and her husband had left their places a week before the attack and the husband's whereabouts were not known. Raids were being carried out to find the husband and other facilitators, he said.

The CTD official also made it clear that Shari Baloch was not a student at the KU and in fact had done her BE and ME from the University of Balochistan and had also worked as a government teacher.

The officer said that the outlawed BLA had claimed responsibility for the attack and shared details about the attacker on their social media platforms. ""We also suspect the involvement of a hostile foreign agency in this attack,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the members of Baloch Student Council at Punjab University held a demonstration outside the varsity and demanded release of Bebagr. They said the ""abduction of Bebagr'' was part of ongoing disappearances and harassment of the Baloch students in the country. They said they would continue their protest till the release of Bebagr from the agencies' custody.

The suicide bombing at the Karachi University seems to be the harbinger of a 'new and unexpected dimension' in the dynamics of terrorism in Pakistan, particularly the Baloch insurgency.

Meanwhile, Additional Police Surgeon at the Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Hospital Dr Summaiya Syed said that the four people who were injured in the bomb blast, including a fourth Chinese teacher, Wang Yuqing, are out of danger.

Those killed in the suicide bombing included three Chinese faculty members and their Pakistani driver, Khalid Nawaz.

In the FIR lodged about the incident by SHO Basharat Hussain, the BLA Majeed Brigade militant commanders Bashir Zaib and Rehman Gul and others were involved in the attack.

The FIR says the BLA wanted to undermine relations between Pakistan and China and get publicity for their outlawed outfit through terrorist acts, the FIR added.

The security forces on Thursday raided the house of the father of the bomber in a society located in Karachi's Scheme 33. Laptops and other evidence, including documents, were seized during the raid.

The Security agencies in Balochistan on Wednesday also searched the apartment of the suicide bomber in Gulistan-e-Johar and sealed it afterwards. The apartment was rented and the bomber had been living there for the last three years.

The Karachi University reopened for the first time on Thursday after the suicide attack.

The university's spokesperson said that administrative affairs and the teaching process in the university will continue as usual. However, the Confucius institute will remain closed until clearance from the Chinese embassy.

Newly-appointed Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited the Chinese embassy in Islamabad shortly after he took charge on Wednesday.

Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb told a press conference that the government was reviewing the National Action Plan against terrorism and would bring the perpetrators of the Karachi bombing to justice.

China has demanded stern action against the militant organisations behind the attack. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin during a media briefing asked Pakistan to scale-up security for its nationals working in the country and demanded a thorough investigation and punishment to the perpetrators behind the suicide attack.

The attack that too by a woman suicide bomber from BLA, which is vocally opposing the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), sent shock waves in China as it highlights deep rooted opposition to Chinese projects. Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency. Baloch insurgent groups have previously carried out several attacks targeting the CPEC projects.

Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on a host of projects being carried out under the aegis of the CPEC.

"After the horrific attack on a minibus in Karachi, China's confidence in Pakistan's ability to protect the Chinese workers in the country is 'seriously shaken'. This comes in the wake of the killing of three Chinese nationals and a Pakistani van driver who lost their lives in a car explosion inside the premises of the Karachi University of Pakistan on April 26.

In a conversation with the Pakistani media outlet Dawn, Senator Mushahid Hussain, the chairman of the Senate Defence Committee, said, ""The Chinese confidence in Pakistan's security system's ability to protect their citizens and their projects is seriously shaken."" ""It has caused serious concern and understandable indignation in China. More so, the pattern of attacks is so recurring and it's clear that Pakistani promises of 'foolproof security' are mere words, not matched by countermeasures on the ground,"" he maintained.

He slammed Pakistan's security system for being indolent. Senate Defence said that the security agencies seemed to have been caught napping. ""If such attacks continue, not just Chinese but other foreign investors will be forced to review their role in Pakistan,"" he added.

He made these remarks while sharing the mood on the Chinese side following the deadly attack. Earlier, Senator Mushahid led a Senate delegation to the Chinese embassy last week to express condolences over the loss of three Chinese lives in a suicide attack on their van on the university's premises last month. This is the third terrorist attack on Chinese citizens on Pakistani soil in a year, as per the media portal.

According to many reports circulated around social media, the Chinese workers are leaving Pakistan after the attacks. However, a Chinese source denied these claims of ""exodus"". The three Chinese individuals who were killed were professors of the Confucius institute. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has also condemned the attack. (ANI)

"Ever since Beijing started implementing its expansionist policies and crushing the voices of dissidents, the feeling of resistance is fast developing in its neighbouring countries and occupied territories. Although neighbouring Pakistan is China's close ally, the people here are raising their voices against Beijing for its continuous exploitation of resources and violating human rights.

The Chinese working in Pakistan are facing resistance and they are being attacked several times. On April 24 three Chinese nationals and a local man were killed after what appeared to be a targeted suicide bombing in Karachi, outside the University of Karachi's Confucius institute. The suicide attack was carried out by Shari Baloch of Baloch Liberation Army, which opposes Chinese investment in their territory.

In 2018, the group also attacked the Chinese Consulate-General in Karachi in South Pakistan, during which two police officers were killed. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), one of the six limbs of China's Silk Road Economic Belt has been criticised as a form of colonization, that will doom Islamabad into being a vassal of Beijing. China even rejected Pakistan Navy's security concerns over priority to speedy completion of CPEC projects in Gwadar.

The Pakistan Navy has to vacate 20 acres of prime land in Gwadar after the Cabinet Committee that oversees all CPEC-related work in Pakistan decided against the Navy. In Myanmar, the National Unity Government (NUG) has also warned China's government that its engagement with the country's military Junta could seriously damage China's international reputation, just days after China's foreign minister pledged Beijing's support for the military.

The warning was issued in a statement on April 4 by the NUG's Ministry of Foreign Affairs after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Wunna Maung Lwin, the Junta's Foreign Minister, in China on April 1. The NUG stated that it was committed to good relations with China, but that this had to be constructed on the basis of the NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar.

During last June, Wang met with Wunna Maung Lwin and said that ""in the past, present, and future, China supports Myanmar to independently choose a development path that suits its national conditions."" These comments were echoed by Wang on April 1, when he said that China ""will support Myanmar in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions.""

Sri Lanks's economic instability is largely caused by China's debt-trap diplomacy. Defaults over China's infrastructure-related loans to Sri Lanka, especially the financing of the Hambantota Port, are being cited as factors contributing to the crisis.

The construction of the Hambantota Port was financed by the Chinese Exim Bank. The Port was running into losses, so Sri Lanka leased out the Port for 99 years to the Chinese Merchant's Group, which paid Sri Lanka USD 1.12 billion. Sri Lanka appears to be on the edge of a ""humanitarian crisis"", according to the United Nations Development Programme, as its financial troubles grow, with rising food prices, and the country's coffers having run dry.

According to World Bank estimates, five lakh people in Sri Lanka have fallen below the poverty line since the onset of the crisis. As Sri Lanka faces its worst economic crisis in decades and struggles to pay loans, China turns a blind eye after ensnaring the island nation into a debt trap.

As the economic crisis took hold of Sri Lanka, India on the contrary has made a serious effort to bail out its beleaguered neighbor. Since January, it has helped Sri Lanka with USD 2.4 billion, including a USD 400 million currency swap and a USD 500-million loan deferment. Last month, Sri Lanka signed a USD 1-billion credit line with India for the procurement of food, medicines and other essential items. Meanwhile, China has refused to offer any concessions in debt repayment.

Total debt to China stands at USD 8 billion, almost one-sixth of Sri Lanka's total external debut of USD 45 billion. China's relations with Nepal are also weakening. In January, Nepal Airlines had grounded six Chinese-made aircrafts, saying that it was proving to be unaffordable to fly them.

These sub-standard planes delivered extremely poor serviceability rates and required heavy maintenance. The loan from China for these aircrafts has, however, continued to haunt the airlines. Dues worth $35.1 million, at a steep interest rate along with a service charge and management expenses, are still pending.

Not only Nepal, China's supply of sub-standard military equipment to Bangladesh has also irked the Muslim majority nation. The Bangladesh military imported two Type-035G submarines of 1970s vintage and Type-053H frigates from China, with its import dependence on Chinese hardware touching nearing 85 per cent.

Beijing had gifted two 1970s era Ming class Type-035G submarines to Bangladesh valued at $100-million each in 2017. These were later re-inducted by the Bangladesh Navy as BNS Nobojatra and BNS Joyjatra. However, both the platforms have been lying idle due to technical issues and could not be used as intended.

The year 2020, witnessed China gifting Dhaka with two Chinese 053H3 frigates - BNS Umar Farooq and BNS Abu Ubaidah. The Type-053H3 frigates gifted to the Bangladesh Navy have defects in the fire control system as well as in the helicopter fueling and defueling system. Defects have also been discovered in the gyro compass. Not only the neighbours, the territories under China including Xinjiang and Tibet are facing several human rights crises. This indicates that anti-China sentiments are high in the region. (ANI)

"China has recalled instructors teaching at the Confucius institute of the University of Karachi, who left for their country, weeks after the Karachi blast resulted in the death of three Chinese nationals. Back in 2013, the Confucius institute at Karachi University was jointly established with Sichuan Normal University in China.

The institute aims to teach mandarin, and promote people-to-people exchanges between China and Pakistan. This return of Chinese instructors to their home country comes against the backdrop of the suicide attack at the University of Karachi targeting Chinese nationals on April 26 outside the Confucius institute. The suicide attack resulted in the death of four people, including three Chinese nationals.

The director of the department told Geo News on Sunday that the teachers at the different Confucius institutes in the country, not just the University of Karachi, have been called back by China. Director Dr Nasir Uddin said that the institute will not be closed, adding that Pakistani teachers are being asked to help in teaching Mandarin.

Last month, China's confidence in Pakistan's ability to protect the Chinese workers in the country was 'seriously shaken' after the attack on a minibus in Karachi.

"Chinese nationals teaching Mandarin in different parts of Pakistan have left for home after being called back by Beijing following the recent deadly attacks targeting them, an official of the Karachi University said on Monday.

Their departure came weeks after a burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber struck a van inside Pakistan's prestigious University of Karachi, killing three Chinese teachers, including the head of the department, and their local driver, in the latest targeted attack against Chinese citizens in the country's financial capital.

The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) linked Majeed Brigade claimed responsibility for the attack on the teachers that took place on April 26 near China-built Confucius institute - a non-profit institute teaching Chinese language to local pupils - in the university.

An official at the University of Karachi said that the Chinese teachers who were teaching at the Confucius institute on the campus left for home on Sunday.

""There were other Chinese teachers working at different campuses in the country and they left yesterday,"" he said.

Director of the Confucius institute at the Karachi University, Dr Nasir Uddin, said that the departure of the Chinese teachers was a big setback for the students learning Mandarin.

""We have around 500 students enrolled at the institute and we are now considering having online classes for them so that their term is completed,"" he said.

He said that the teachers at the different Confucius institutes in the country have been called back by their government.

Nasir Uddin said that the Confucius institute is a non-profit educational set-up which aims to teach Mandarin, deepen international understanding of the language, and Chinese culture, and promote people-to-people exchanges between China and Pakistan.

The BLA suicide bomb attack on April 26 had killed the head of the institute, Huang Guiping, and two other Chinese teachers, Chen Sai and Ding Mupeng, while their local driver Khalid Nawaz also died in the blast.

The Chinese government in the past reacted strongly to attacks on its nationals working in Pakistan.

The BLA opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, especially in the restive Balochistan, saying local people do not benefit.

Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency. Baloch insurgent groups have previously carried out several attacks targeting the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.

This was not the first time Chinese nationals have been the target of terror attacks in Karachi, which is Pakistan's biggest city and economic hub.

In July last year, masked armed men on a motorcycle opened fire on a vehicle carrying two Chinese nationals in Karachi in which one of them was critically wounded.

In the same month, nearly a dozen Chinese engineers were killed when a bus carrying construction workers was ''attacked'' in northwest Pakistan.

In November 2018, Baloch militants had attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi but failed to break through the security barrier with three of them killed on the spot.

Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on a host of projects being carried out under the aegis of the CPEC.

"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is personally supervising issues related to the security of Chinese citizens working in Pakistan, Interior Minister Rana Sana Ullah Khan told a top Chinese official on Wednesday, as Beijing pressed Islamabad to expedite the probe into the suicide attack at the Karachi University that killed three Chinese language teachers. Khan gave this assurance to the Counsellor of the Department of External Security Affairs of China Wang Daxue when he called on him in Islamabad, the official APP news agency reported. Three Chinese language teachers and their Pakistani driver were killed in a suspected suicide bombing in the southern city of Karachi on April 26. The powerful blast ripped through their minibus, injuring at least four others near the university's Confucius institute.

The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) said it attacked the vehicle carrying the Chinese staff, and that the suicide bomber had been a woman.

During the meeting, the two sides discussed ways to ensure security of Chinese nationals in Pakistan, the report said.

Prime Minister Sharif was personally monitoring the security of Chinese citizens, the interior minister told Wang. The meeting took place a day after Prime Minister Sharif held a telephonic talk with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and discussed tightening of security for Chinese nationals working in Pakistan.

He said a Foreign National Security Desk had been set up at the Interior Ministry to provide effective liaison to ensure the security of foreigners in Pakistan, especially Chinese nationals.

He also said culprits involved in Karachi University would be given exemplary punishment.

The two sides expressed their resolve that Pakistan-China relations would not be affected by Karachi like incidents. Both the sides agreed to make liaison more effective between Interior Ministry and Chinese Embassy to ensure security.

The Pakistani Interior minister expressed sorrow and grief over the loss of lives of Chinese nationals in Karachi University terror incident.

Wang said the two countries would foil all conspiracies of miscreants to spoil Pak-China relations.

He expressed the hope that the investigation into the Karachi University terror incident would be completed soon and the culprits would be taken to task, the report said.

The Chinese leadership attached great importance to Pak-China relations, Wang said.

The Pakistani minister said that foolproof security arrangements had been made for Chinese nationals working on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects in the country.

The banned separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, saying the local people do not benefit from these projects.

The group has targeted Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects on a number of occasions.

China is heavily involved in large infrastructure projects across Pakistan, including in resource-rich Balochistan province. The USD 60 billion CPEC, is a network of roads, railway and pipelines between the two countries which forms part of Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. During the meeting, Wang assured Khan that said China will continue financial and technical cooperation in ongoing development projects with Pakistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.

"China's cultural promotion centre Confucius institutes, which was accused of being a propaganda arm for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is being rebranded and reopened in the United States, a media report said. As many as 104 out of the total 118 Confucius institutes were closed last week in the US and four more are in the process of shutting down, the Voice of America (VOA) reported citing National Association of Scholars' report.

Of these, at least 28 have replaced their Confucius institute with a similar program, and at least 58 have maintained close relationships with their former Confucius institute partner, the VOA citing the report. Perry Link, professor of Chinese language studies at the University of California Riverside, told VOA Mandarin that he was surprised first by how many Confucius institutes have been shut down in the US.

""I didn't expect the rate of closures to be so high. Second, they still exist in another way with another name. I think this is expected. I just didn't expect it to happen so soon,"" he said. Confucius institutes are public educational partnerships between colleges and universities in China and colleges and universities in other countries.

The controversial Chinese government-funded institutions have previously been accused of being a propaganda arm for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In recent years, the closure of Confucius institutes in various countries has progressed rapidly as these organizations are deemed as China's ideological marketing machine.

Earlier in February, nearly a dozen countries, including the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands, tightened their grip on Confucius institutes and other related activities over the dubious nature of the Chinese organizations. A report on ""China's Influence Actions"" released by a military institute, under the French Defence Ministry, pointed out that the Chinese government has been promoting United Front tactics overseas and promoting its ideology through Confucius institutes.

The United Front is a political strategy of the CCP involving networks of groups and key individuals that are influenced or controlled by the CCP and used to advance its interests. In 2020, the Department of State designated the Confucius institutes as a foreign mission of the People's republic of China due to the organisation's state-directed nature. It is mandatory for organisation's designed as foreign missions to submit reports about funding, personnel, curriculum and activities to the US government.

Since 2004, the Chinese government has sponsored Confucius institutes on college and university campuses around the world, providing teachers, textbooks, and operating funds. As of December 2019, it has established 550 Confucius institutes and more than 1,000 Confucius Classrooms in primary and secondary schools in 162 countries or regions around the world. Until an agency of the Chinese Ministry of Education, the Hanban, oversaw Confucius institutes.

In the wake of widespread criticism, the Chinese government had reorganized Confucius institutes under a new organization, the Chinese International Education Foundation. (ANI)

"China is in a state of shock after Pakistan turned down its request to open a security company in their country. Islamabad has not made its objections public but Beijing is not hiding its unhappiness, reported a think tank, Policy Research Group (POREG).

According to sources, China had requested to set up a security company in Pakistan to protect its nationals working in the Islamic Republic from Islamist militants of all hues. The request was sent to the government by the Chinese Ministry of State Security, however, the Interior Ministry has objected to the Chinese government's request. Pakistan's Interior Minister, Rana Sanaullah maintained that no other country can open a security company in Pakistan.

""Chinese confidence in Pakistan's security system and its ability to protect them and their projects is badly shaken as Senator Mushahid Hussain, Chairman of Pakistan's Senate Defence Committee has conceded on record recently,"" Valentin Popescu said in the POREG report. ""Whether Pakistani leadership likes to admit it or not, there is a sublime anti-China sentiment in the land of the pure as Pakistanis like to describe their country. It is not as widespread as the anti-American psyche, though,"" Popescu said.

""Probably, this dislike bordering on hatred is a manifestation against the Big Brother attitude of the US and China,"" he added. He further said that the provocation for China to propose its own security arrangement in Pakistan was an attack near the University of Karachi's Confucius institute on 26 April 2022, where three Chinese teachers lost their lives in the ghastly attack carried out by a woman suicide bomber.

""Punish the perpetrators,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesman thundered in Beijing. And demanded a scale-up of security for the Chinese nationals. ""Shehbaz Sharif, who took over reins of the country at the head of a multiparty coalition, just a fortnight before the Karachi attack, was rattled. So was the military establishment, which is the real power centre of the country,"" Popescu said.

""Both held out the assurance of stern action against the perpetrators. It did not cut any ice with China, going by the turn of events ending with the request 'for permission to set up a security company in Pakistan,"" Popescu added. There are more than 1,000 Chinese nationals in Islamabad alone, attached to three dozen of projects, companies, and businesses, according to an official survey on the number of Chinese living in Pakistan.

""Hundreds of Chinese are working in Pakistan on a wide range of projects. One project, CPEC, is a multi-billion-dollar venture to lay an economic corridor from Xinjiang in Northwest China to the Balochistan coast in Pakistan. The Chinese workers and engineers have literally no security cover even in Karachi, which is Pakistan's showpiece city as its educational and business hub,"" Popescu said. He further said that it is not that Pakistan does not care for the 'guests' from the land of its iron friend. It does. It has, in fact, raised a special force to protect the Chinese nationals, almost all of them unarmed civilians.

""Many of them are working in inaccessible tribal areas with militant sanctuaries. In urban and semi-urban centres, they face the music at the hands of Islamist vigilantes. And from insurgents in Balochistan, who are unhappy with Islamabad and Beijing alike."" It is easy to say that the Chinese are courting trouble through their swagger and their attitude, which is aggressive and domineering.

They are the 21st-century indentured labourers furthering ""China's ambitious bid to be the hegemon and Hercules of the universe"". They are only basking in the reflex glory of their Yuans, which have made the Pakistani rupees its supplicant, reported POREG. The attacks may indicate a concern amongst the locals that the new East India Company is exploiting their resources, and is creating unemployment.

It may be true but this argument does not hide Pakistan's failure in its sovereign duty of protecting unarmed foreigners, who have crossed the strategic Khunjerab Pass on the southwest border of China to create a better tomorrow for the world's second-largest Muslim country even as China's Africa story finds an echo, Popescu said.

"China collects vast swathes of information from around the world, by fair or foul means, as part of its national intelligence apparatus. Some of this spying is done by individuals and businesses, but a great deal of it is sanctioned by the Chinese government. Indeed, on 3 November 2021, the Pentagon's 21st edition of its China Military Power Report contained a whole section on Chinese espionage. Illustrating the sheer volume of Chinese efforts to steal sensitive data or items, in 2020 the FBI opened a China-related counterintelligence case every ten hours on average.

Furthermore, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that, in 2020, the FBI had nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases on its books, of which nearly half related to China. Stunningly, economic espionage cases linked to China have increased by 1,300% in the past decade. The Pentagon also disclosed, ""The People's Republic of China's [PRC] efforts to acquire sensitive, dual-use or military-grade equipment included radiation-hardened integratedcircuits, monolithic microwave integrated circuits, accelerometers, gyroscopes, naval and marine technologies, syntactic foam trade secrets, space communications, military communication jamming equipment, dynamic random access memory, aviation technologies and anti-submarine warfare.""

One example includes the Chinese national Qingshan Li who was sentenced to three years in prison in June 2020 for attempting to send to China an export-controlled radio. Then, in September 2020, another Chinese national pleaded guilty to conspiring to fraudulently exportmaritime raiding craft and engines to China. Such engines can power submersibles launched from a submarine, or dropped into the ocean by aircraft. Further examples are manifold. On 16 September 2020, the US Department of Justice charged five Chinese hackers with breaching more than 100 companies, think tanks, universities and government agencies around the world.

One of the most recent was Xu Yanjun, a Chinese intelligence officer convicted of plotting to steal secrets from aviation companies. Alan Kohler, FBI Assistant Director, warned, ""For those who doubt the real goals of [China], this should be a wakeup call. They are stealingAmerican technology to benefit their economy and military."" Indeed, prosecutions of Chinese nationals and those abetting them have become almost commonplace, but few are as amateurish as Yujing Zhang, the 33-year-old Shanghai business consultant who was arrested at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in 2019.

China commonly uses or targets overseas Chinese nationals or ethnic Chinese to do its bidding. It might do so through coercion, blackmail or manipulation. For example, it can threaten relatives in China with imprisonment if cooperation is not forthcoming. This is very common amongst the Uighur diaspora, for instance, where more than a million Uighurs are already incarcerated in concentration camps. It seeks to gain technological advantage from overseas through such measures as its ""Thousand Talents Program"" that targets ethnic Chinese or recent emigrants. Defense technology is particularly prized by China.

Beijing also utilizes academia, educational institutions, think-tanks and state-run media to advance its soft power. Chinese students might organize protests against the Dalai Lama, for example. Specific examples are the Chinese Students and Scholars Associations and Confucius institutes. Western countries are slowly cottoning on to the nefarious methods of communist China, but Beijing is still taking advantage of lax regulations. In Italy, for example, it was discovered that two Chinese state firms covertly took control of Italian military drone-maker Alpi Aviation in 2018 via an offshore company. The Italian authorities are now investigating the deal.

Foreign investment, commercial joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions are favored methods by China to glean knowhow, although illicit means are also considered entirely valid. Beijing is interested in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous vehicles, quantuminformation sciences, augmented and virtual reality, financial technology and biotechnology, where the lines between commercial and military use can become somewhat blurred. The 2015 breach of the US Office of Personnel Management is suspected to have originated in China. It is considered the largest breach of US federal government data ever, with employee records of four million current or former employees, and this would have delivereda goldmine of useful information to China.

China does not only glean or steal data, but it also attempts to shape a positive image of itself through underhand means. The US Department of Defense noted, ""...The PRC conducts influence operations to achieve outcomes favorable to its security and military strategy objectives by targeting cultural institutions, media organizations, business, academic and policy communities of the UnitedStates, other countries and international institutions.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seeks to condition domestic, foreign and multilateral political establishments and public opinion to accept the PRC's narrative surrounding its priorities such as promulgation of Beijing's 'one China principle', One Belt One Road, the CCP's political control over Hong Kong, and South China Sea territorial and maritime claims."" It added that Chinese ""influence operations are coordinated at a high level and executed by a range of actors, such as the United Front Work Department, the Propaganda Department and the Ministry of State Security"".

Ironically, China's influence activities typically promote the narrative that it does not interfere in others' internal affairs. It wages massive campaigns via the internet and social media platforms, especially on such topics asH Kong and Xinjiang. Even the ongoing case of tennis player Peng Shuai illustrates how the CCP attempts to manipulate public opinion. The Pentagon explained, ""In wartime or peacetime, PLA goals for social media influence activities fall into three broad categories: promote a narrative favorable to the PRC, undermine adversary resolve and shape foreign governments' policies in favor of Beijing's interests."" Without a doubt, the PLA also uses covert social media accounts to target people of influence, one example being the 2018 Taiwanese elections.

Quite apart from its own spying, China is increasingly a difficult place for foreign powers to conduct their own intelligence activities. Technologies such as facial recognition, gait detection and speech recognition, integrated into software algorithms that have access tomillions of individuals' profiles, make it almost impossible to evade detection. Indeed, Shephard Media reported that ""former US intelligence officers are warning that human intelligence operations within China will collapse or become non-existent as these systems go online"".

Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow with the Center for a New American Security's Technology and National Security Program, told Shephard Media that China's widespread deployment of facial recognition was enabling powerful, pervasive surveillance that could enhance itscounterespionage capabilities. Kania said, ""Beijing's prioritization of these applications of AI technologies reflects an intense concern with counterespionage, which has also been the focus of a range of campaigns and propaganda."" Further, Kania explained that China's employment of a range of biometrics could be creating a highly contested environment for anyone seeking to operate without detection or identification.

China collects the fingerprints of all foreigners entering China as part of a larger effort by Beijing to strengthen state control over the population and to expand anti-spy campaigns. Even at some Chinese airports, one only need stand in front of an information board for an integrated camera to recognize who you are and then direct you to your gate number for your flight. This is Orwellian China. Furthermore, such databases that can rapidly identify individuals are not just found in China. Chinese companies such as Poly Technology, Hikvision and Yitu Technology offer data collection software that can be sold to foreign countries. Yitu products have been used at events such as the G20 Summit, BRICS Summit and Boao Forum for Asia, for example.

Given China's draconian control over every Chinese business operations, it is likely that such data can find its way back to China. This means there is nowhere to hide, as China can track millions of people digitally. Even signing up for a Confucius institute course to learn Mandarin will get you into the database with biometric and personal details. The CIA's operations in China were severely damaged by Jerry Chun Shing Lee, who was arrested by the FBI and sentenced in 2019. Until 2007, Lee was a CIA officer based in Hong Kong that handled Chinese agents. He was accused of identifying scores of CIA sources, withChina rolling up a network of American informants from 2010-12.

Then, in 2017, Kevin Mallory was arrested by the FBI after allegedly meeting Chinese intelligence operatives in Shanghai. Mallory had served in China and Taiwan as a special agent in the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service with a ""top secret"" clearance. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2019. Another arrested was former US intelligence officer Ron Rockwell Hansen who was sentenced in 2019 to ten years. Unsurprisingly, a lot of China's intelligence efforts are aimed squarely at Taiwan, a nation that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) threatens with ongoing aircraft flybys and naval circumnavigations.

Another arm of that threat is through espionage. Reuters recently published a story about Xie Xizhang, who posed as a Hong Kong businessman as he routinely visited Taiwan over a 20-year period to recruit spies for China. His converts included retired Taiwanese navy officer Chang Pei-ning and other military commanders. They were lured by such things as expenses-paid trips abroad, cash payments and gifts. The ensnarement often began with small gifts such as meals and drinks. Taiwan counterintelligence officers moved against Xie in June 2019, but China's espionage successes even reached into the security detail of President Tsai Ing-wen. A retired presidential security officer and a serving military police lieutenant colonel both had their convictions upheld earlier this year; they had leaked sensitive information about Tsai's security to Chinese intelligence.

In the past decade, at least 21 serving or retired Taiwanese officers ranked captain or above have been convicted of spying for China. At least nine others are on trial or being investigated, including a retired major general and three retired colonels from the Military Intelligence Bureau who allegedly recruited spies for China. Even General Chang Che-ping, Taiwan's former deputy defense minister, is being questioned in a national security investigation after he had contacts with Xie. These spying cases must have an effect on the morale of the armed forces, where suspicion grows about senior officers' loyalties. Mistrust in others can set in like a rot. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense insists there has been no infiltration of the military, but the USA will be alarmed about these repeated cases. Consequently, it is always hesitant about sharing its latest military technologies in case they find their way into Chinese hands.

But as can be seen, although Taiwan is one epicenter of Chinese spying, Beijing's espionage and influence efforts span the world. The nation is always on the lookout for new technologies, for new data and for new recruits. Extreme caution is advised. (ANI)

"Two Chinese women were among four people killed and several others injured on Tuesday when a blast took place in a van inside the premises of the University of Karachi in Pakistan鈥檚 financial capital, officials said.

According to reports, the blast took place in the van near Confucius institute in the university 鈥?a non-profit institute teaching Chinese language to local pupils.

Initial information from a reliable police source said that the two women killed in the blast were Chinese nationals and may have been the target of the blast.

The two others killed were the driver and security guard in the van while four other people who were close to the van when the blast took place were injured. Three of them are in serious condition, the source said.

There were conflicting reports about the blast but senior police official Muqqadas Haider said that initial investigations were being held and it could have been a remote controlled explosive device planted inside or near the van.

Urdu language Jang newspaper reported that the van was bringing the two foreign nationals who used to teach Chinese at the IBA institute inside the Karachi University from their guesthouse when the blast took place.

There were two Rangers personnel behind the van on motorcycles.

Videos of the van in which the blast took place were also posted on social media with flames of fire completely destroying the vehicle as police and paramilitary rangers reached the scene immediately and cordoned off the areas.

This is not the first time Chinese nationals have been the target of terror attacks in Karachi, which is Pakistan鈥檚 biggest city and economic hub."
"Teachers in India will now get to learn Chinese under an agreement reached between the Indian education board and China's overseas language institute.

The Confucius institute Headquarters and India's Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) have agreed to promote Chinese language training in India, reported Xinhua.

According to an agreement signed between the headquarters and CBSE Friday, both sides have agreed to increase exchanges of language teachers and students, with an agreement to help Indian schools develop Chinese curriculae and textbooks.

Xu Lin, a top official, said the move will strengthen economic and education-related ties between the two countries.

In April, the CBSE made Chinese a foreign language subject for middle school students in 500 schools. It plans to gradually promote the study of Chinese in 11,500 middle schools.

Prior to the signing of the agreement, an Indian delegation paid a visit to the Confucius institute Headquarters in October 2011. The authorities promised to help train 300 Indian language teachers and offer 100 scholarships annually for Chinese language learners from India.

During the October trip, the headquarters also promised to establish an interschool communication mechanism regarding language teaching between Chinese and Indian schools.

This is not the first time Chinese nationals have been the target of terror attacks in Karachi.

In July 2021, masked armed men on a motorcycle opened fire on a vehicle carrying two Chinese nationals in an industrial area of Karachi in which one of them was critically wounded, news agency PTI reported."
"On Tuesday, three Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in a suicide bombing at Karachi University, outside its Confucius institute, a Chinese culture and education outreach centre supported by the Chinese Ministry of Education. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack, also claiming that it was carried out by a female suicide bomber.

The BLA, which announced itself in 2005 with a rocket attack on a paramilitary camp in Balochistan Kohlu during a visit by then President Pervez Musharraf, is a nationalist militant group that has been waging an insurgency for Baloch self-determination and a separate homeland for the Baloch people.

Balochistan borders Afghanistan and Iran. With gas, oil, copper and gold deposits, it is the most resource-rich of Pakistan鈥檚 four provinces. It makes up half of Pakistan鈥檚 area, but has only 3.6% of its population.

Much before Pakistan bought into Chinese President Xi Jinping鈥檚 BRI initiative and the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Musharraf had handed over Gwadar, a fishing village on the Baloch coastline, to the Chinese for development of a deep-water port that would provide China access from the Karokoram Pass to the Arabian Sea.

Baloch nationalism

While the BLA鈥檚 armed insurgency is about two decades old, demands of Baloch nationalists for political autonomy and threats of secession date back to 1947 when the Khan of Kalat (who claimed sovereignty over the four princely states of Kalat, Lasbela, Kharan and Makran) held out for independence, and the Pakistan Army forced his accession in March 1948. Between 1973 and 1977, the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto-led government sent in the Pakistan Army to crush a leftist guerilla war inspired by the liberation of Bangladesh.

The tribal sardars of Balochistan, who had been at the forefront of Baloch nationalism, and were co-opted by the state in the late 1970s, grew rebellious again in the early years of this century as Musharraf bypassed them in his vision of Balochistan as strategic territory that would bring China and Pakistan closer. The insurgency gathered momentum from 2006, after the Pakistan Army killed the Bugti sardar, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who had been also been a chief minister and governor of the province. His grandson Brahumdagh Bugti is said to be based in Afghanistan.

Another tribal sardar, Khair Baksh Marri, who was among the early rebels against the Pakistan state, is considered the founder of the BLA, and after he died of old age in 2014, the leadership is alleged by Pakistan to have passed to his son Hyrbairr. He lives in self-exile in London where he campaigns for an independent Balochistan, but denies links to the BLA.

The Pakistan Army鈥檚 operations against Baloch militancy over the last two decades have seen hundreds of disappearances, and other alleged human rights violations. Baloch nationalists also see the sudden influx of jihadist groups such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Lashkar-e-Toiba in the province as a move by the Pakistan security establishment to counter their nationalist demands.

According to journalist Malik Siraj Akbar in Huffpost, this phase of the Baloch armed struggle posed challenges to the Pakistani state because it 鈥渞eached the breadth and width of Balochistan鈥?(the) movement involved Baloch women and children who supported the armed groups through regular protest rallies鈥?In 2012, the US Congress convened a hearing on Balochistan and supported the demand for a free Baloch land鈥?

Pakistan has long alleged that the insurgency is backed by India. It alleges that India had training camps for Baloch rebels in Afghanistan. As Pakistan put pressure on Afghanistan to crack down on Baloch militants on its territory, there were reports in 2017 that Brahumdagh Bugti had applied for Indian citizenship. New Delhi did not confirm or deny the reports. Other reports said he had applied for asylum in Switzerland. The 2019 US designation of the BLA, at a time when the Trump administration wanted Pakistan鈥檚 help for talks with the Taliban, put further pressure on the Baloch insurgency.

China target in 2nd wind

After a lull in the middle of the last decade, the BLA made a sudden return in 2017, with a drive-by shooting of 10 workers building a Chinese road project that was part of the CPEC. From then on, BLA has claimed several attacks on Chinese targets in Balochistan and outside.

A November 2018 attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi, in which four Pakistanis were killed, was claimed by the BLA. In May 2019, another attack claimed by the BLA targeted a five-star hotel in Gwadar, where Chinese delegations stayed. In July 2020, BLA gunmen attacked the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi 鈥?the bourse had sold 40% stake to a Chinese consortium in 2016.

Suicide bombers & BLA

It is rare that the BLA has deployed suicide bombers. Two previous instances have been an attack in Dalbandin on a bus carrying Chinese engineers, and an attack on the home of the Baloch politician Naseer Mengal, which he survived but in which 13 others were killed. Tuesday marked the first time the group had deployed a woman on a suicide attack.

Shari Baloch, who carried out the attack, was a mother of two. Her husband is a dentist and her father a government employee. She had degrees in Zoology and Philosophy. Although her motivations are not clear, the BLA claimed in a statement that she had voluntarily signed up to the 鈥渟elf-sacrificing鈥?mission after enlisting in the Majeed Brigade, a sub-group of the BLA, two years ago.

The Majeed Brigade is named after Abdul Majeed Baloch, who is said to have tried to make an attempt on the life of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto at a public meeting in Quetta in 1974 and was shot down on the spot.

This is also the first time that a non-jihadist ethno-nationalist group has deployed a woman suicide bomber in the manner of Sri Lanka鈥檚 LTTE. According to security experts familiar with the Baloch insurgency, it marks a worsening security situation, and points to a growing anger in the Baloch population against the Chinese presence. As the training camps are alleged by Pakistan to be in Afghanistan, the incident may also be a pointer to Pakistan鈥檚 loss of control in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan."

ATTACK ON CHINESE NATIONALS IN PAKISTAN

In July 2021, two Chinese nationals were fired at by unidentified assailants on a motorcycle in Pakistan's Karachi. The incident came two weeks after an IED attack on a bus carrying Chinese engineers to the Dasu dam site in Upper Kohistan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At least 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed in the incident.

Last April, a bomb exploded at a hotel hosting the Chinese Ambassador in Quetta in southwestern Pakistan, killing four people.

While the Karachi suicide bombing is part of an intensifying Baloch pushback against the $54 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), it also spotlights the larger and deeper struggle for Balochistan鈥檚 freedom.

BALOCHISTAN AND BLA

Let鈥檚 first understand Balochistan. Rich in natural resources, it鈥檚 Pakistan鈥檚 largest but also poorest province, with Quetta as its capital. On March 27, 1948 (observed as Black Day by Baloch people), a newborn Pakistan annexed the Baloch state, marking the beginning of a long-running insurgency.

ALSO READ | 3 Chinese nationals killed as mother of two blows up van outside Karachi University

Over the years, thousands of people have gone missing in Balochistan, coinciding with a military-led brutal crackdown, often drawing international condemnation. Hundreds of bodies of political activists and suspected armed separatists have been found in the restive province, global media has reported, pointing to extrajudicial killings by Pakistani security agencies.

The insurgency is fuelled by the exploitation of resources and oppression of people, but Pakistan, in denial, blames it on India and Iran, a charge both nations have vehemently rejected.

BLA is the most prominent group fighting for Balochistan鈥檚 independence. Shari Baloch, the 30-year-old suicide bomber in Tuesday鈥檚 attack, had joined the ""special self-sacrifice squad"" of BLA鈥檚 Majeed Brigade two years ago.

A senior leader of the Balochistan freedom movement, Prof Naela Quadri Baloch, who is in exile in Canada, has said that a Government of Balochistan in Exile (GBE) has been established. On the other hand, it's China that鈥檚 emerged as a crucial player in Balochistan.

CHINA IN BALOCHISTAN

China had long been interested in Balochistan鈥檚 copper, gold, gas and coal deposits. In 2015, China announced CPEC, an infrastructure network linking a port in Balochistan鈥檚 Gwadar to China's western Xinjiang region. Both the regions -- Xinjiang in China and Balochistan in Pakistan -- are restive and have seen military crackdowns by their national governments.

advertisement

Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on CPEC projects, many of them being built in Balochistan where separatists say Islamabad is exploiting local resources to help Beijing expand its clout. CPEC has also drawn India's objection.

INDIA ON CPEC

India has repeatedly objected to CPEC passing through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and asked both Pakistan and China not to alter the status quo in areas illegally occupied by Pakistan. India has said Jammu & Kashmir as well as Ladakh have been, are and will always remain integral and inalienable parts of India.

Be that as it may, BLA and other separatists from Balochistan have regularly attacked Chinese targets. Tuesday's was only the latest in a string of such cases. Sample some recent incidents.

RECENT ATTACKS

In February 2022, Baloch separatists targeted two Balochistan locations in four days and killed 10 soldiers. Twenty militants were also killed.

In July 2021, a bus carrying engineers in northwestern Pakistan was bombed. Thirteen people including nine Chinese workers died. Under pressure, Pakistan paid millions in compensation to the families of the Chinese workers killed. China sent its team to probe the attack.

In April 2021, a suicide bomb attack at a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese ambassador in Quetta killed four and wounded dozens. The ambassador was unhurt.

Earlier in 2020, Baloch separatists attacked Pakistan鈥檚 Stock Exchange where the Chinese have major investments. This followed an attack at the Chinese consulate in Karachi in 2018.

WHY THESE ATTACKS?

advertisement

But why is there this massive pushback against the Chinese? Baloch separatists have been angry against mining and energy projects in the region. They say there are no benefits for them as most new jobs have gone to outsiders while locals, already battling crushing poverty, are being pushed off their land.

BLA has said that it had warned China several times to 鈥渞efrain from looting Baloch resources. However, China continues to be involved in its expansionist designs in Balochistan.鈥?
鈥淭argeting director and officials of the Confucius institute, the symbol of Chinese economic, cultural and political expansionism, was to give a clear message to China that its direct or indirect presence in Balochistan will not be tolerated,鈥?BLA has said.

The Confucius institutes are a significant Chinese push for soft power across countries but have often been branded as China鈥檚 propaganda mission, also around how Pakistan treats Balochistan.

LARGER BALOCH STRUGGLE

advertisement

The massive Baloch pushback against the CPEC is part of the larger struggle for Balochistan鈥檚 freedom, BLA has said.

BLA has said that it had warned China several times to 鈥渞efrain from aiding Pakistan militarily and financially in carrying out Baloch genocide, but to no avail.鈥?
BLA has said Shari was a member of the Baloch Students鈥?Organisation and was aware of Baloch genocide and occupation of Balochistan.

WHAT NEXT?

After Tuesday鈥檚 attack, Pakistani authorities scrambled to appease China. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has mourned the death of 鈥淐hinese friends鈥? 鈥渟trongly condemned the heinous and cowardly act of terrorism鈥?and promised action against 鈥渢he perpetrators.鈥?
Pakistan's foreign ministry called the suicide blast ""a direct attack on Pakistan-China friendship"". China has said the blood of the Chinese cannot be shed in vain, demanded severe punishment for the attackers and asked Pakistan to do everything possible to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan.

On the other hand, BLA has threatened bigger attacks on Chinese nationals and China鈥檚 interests in Balochistan and elsewhere in Pakistan.

BLA has asked China to immediately halt its 鈥渆xploitation projects鈥?and refrain from aiding 鈥渢he occupying Pakistani state鈥?as 鈥渉undreds of highly trained BLA members are ready to carry out deadly attacks.鈥?BLA also asked Pakistan to withdraw from Balochistan, 鈥渞ecognising its independence鈥?

So what comes next? Tuesday鈥檚 attack is a crucial challenge for the new Pakistan government, installed after weeks of political turmoil that saw Imran Khan鈥檚 ouster as Pakistan鈥檚 prime minister, at a time when the Pakistan-Afghanistan border is already on fire.

Given the confrontational posturing of Pakistan, China and BLA, the coming days may see more blood in Balochistan and beyond. Pakistan can no longer regard the Baloch insurgency as a low-intensity conflict.

Highlights Pakistani security forces claimed to have arrested mastermind behind the Karachi university blast

The suspect is a commander of separatist organisations Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA)

The court remanded the suspect in police custody till July 16

Pakistani security agencies on Tuesday claimed to have arrested the mastermind of the Karachi University suicide attack in which a burqa-clad Baloch woman bomber killed three Chinese nationals and their local driver in April. The suspect, who was arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) with technical assistance from other law enforcement agencies on Monday, was produced before an anti-terrorism court on Tuesday, Geo TV reported.

The CTD informed the court that the suspect is a commander of separatist organisations Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Federation-Karachi (BLF) and the mastermind of the attack on Chinese teachers outside KU's Confucius institute on April 26, according to the channel. The suspect was also involved in facilitating attacks on other Chinese citizens in Karachi, it said. Later, the court remanded the suspect in police custody till July 16.

Sharing details, Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that suspect Dad Bakhsh alias Shoaib was arrested from Mauripur Road, Hawkesbay, the Dawn newspaper reported. The Karachi University (KU) suicide bombing was a joint plan by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), in which a ""neighbouring country"" had played a role, the minister claimed, without naming the country.

Memon said that the suspect, who he termed a terrorist, had revealed that the KU attack was the joint work of the BLF and the BLA. The banned BLA-linked Majeed Brigade had claimed responsibility for the attack on the Chinese teachers that took place near China-built Confucius institute - a non-profit institute teaching the Chinese language to local pupils - in the KU. A spokesperson of the BLA, the separatist outfit which is banned in Pakistan, the UK and the US, said that the attack was carried out by Shari Baloch alias Bramsh - the ""first female suicide bomber of the brigade"". The attack marks ""a new chapter in the history of Baloch resistance,"" he had said.

After that, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) collected CCTV footage, and conducted geo-fencing and DNA sampling which led to the arrest of the BLF commander in Karachi, the minister said. ""During the investigation process, the suspect made important revelations,"" he said, adding that the suspect also said that he had been conducting recce of different BLA targets on the orders of his organisation's commander, Khalil Baloch alias Musa.

He went on to say that the suspect met with the husband of the female suicide bomber, Dr Haibastan Bashir, and another ""important terrorist"" named ""Zeb"" in Karachi, and helped to carry out the KU attack.

Memon claimed that the suspect had revealed that Zeb was the KU attack mastermind, who entered Pakistan from a ""neighbouring country"" and had been staying in Karachi with Baloch and her husband. He said that while being interrogated, the suspect confessed to conducting reconnaissance in Gulbai along with his accomplice as well as firing at the vehicle of two Chinese engineers in July 2021 which left one injured. Responding to a question, Memon said that the terrorists involved in the attack had foreign assistance but it would not be apt to name at country involved at this stage as the investigation was still ongoing.

""But whichever country is involved, our work is to trace and give strict punishment to those involved and give the message that nobody can cast a dirty eye on Pakistan,"" he said. Memon said that the country in question would be conveyed a message on a government level - in line with diplomatic norms - that their land was being used for terrorist activities. ""I don't think it is appropriate to name any country,"" he said.

Penumbra Dragon in Bangladesh's sky (Opinion)

Shared Recently!

China is creeping up fast in Bangladesh. The intensity of China's interest in Bangladesh suggests that china is interested in more than normal trade. The Chinese eagerness for a strategic presence in Bangladesh is not only related to their export-import profit making and predatory trade, it is actually looking to enter into Bangladesh as the country is the navel point of India. If she could establish her influence in Bangladesh, her grip would be more stronger than ever and India would feel herself vulnerable in all respect.To do that, for decades, Bangladesh is being allured by Chinese Foreign Direct Investment. Months ago, Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming, in a dialogue titled 'Bangladesh-China Development Cooperation Experience and Outlook', organised by the Center For Policy Dialogue, said, ""Chinese investment in Bangladesh is very important for China. We are investing in light to heavy industries and switching investment from low value to value added and mobile and telecommunication. We should consider Chinese investment as a broader vision instead of a narrow vision. We need to join hands to increase political trust.""This 'vision' of the Chinese diplomat is nothing new. On October 14, 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Dhaka with his eagerness to drive new pace of relations between the two. He signed 27 deals, including memorandum of understanding, valued 24 billion US dollar while Chinese and Bangladeshi companies on the sidelines entered 13 joint ventures of 13.6 billion US dollars.The Chinese President, at that time, said, ""We agreed to elevate China-Bangladesh ties from a comprehensive partnership of cooperation to a strategic partnership of cooperation. The two countries announced that 2017 would be the year of exchange and friendship.""In return, on July 5, 2019, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited China and was warmly received by the Chinese Premier at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. At the meeting, the Chinese President reiterated consolidating and developing strategic partnership between the two. Moreover, he said that China is ready to exchange education, culture, youth and media with Bangladesh.During the intensity of the pandemic, in last May, President Xi called Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina over phone and offered an expert team for Bangladesh to help control the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China. In the 25-minute conversation, the Chinese President said, ""We will always beside Bangladesh for its economic uplift and also extend support to the country in the international forum.""In the fiscal year 2019, China has become the largest source of Foreign Direct Investment in Bangladesh. But many experts believe that Bangladesh is entering into a debt trap in the guise of assistance.The equation, however, is not so strait.Besides economic activities, China is strongly trying to push its social influence in Bangladesh. To have a cultural bridge, Chinese cultural programmes are taking place in Dhaka. To entertain the Bangladeshi audience, the Chinese are playing Tagore's play and expressing closelesness by attending local cultural activities.There are dozens of Chinese language schools and institutions in Dhaka under different universities, including the Confucius institute under Dhaka University. China is trying to regroup pro-Chinese politicians in Bangladesh. On the other hand, Bangladeshi students are being inducted in Chinese universities for higher education.Now the question is why the Chinese are toiling to reach out to the Bangladeshis?Traditionally, China is Pakistan's closest ally. During the Liberation War in 1971, China was one of the few countries which strongly supported Pakistan's cause.After the independence of Bangladesh, China did not recognise her. Not only China supported Pakistan during the war, it also vetoed Bangladesh's UN member status in 1974.Like Pakistan, China recognised Bangladesh after the brutal killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of the country. China and Bangladesh established diplomatic relations in 1976. After the killing of Sheikh Mujib, General Ziaur Rahman eventually emerged as the most powerful man of the country.This military man started searching for anti-liberation, anti-Indian and pro-Chinese men to have a strong platform. After becoming President of the country, Ziaur Rahman visited China for closer relations and the Chinese leaders started to visit Bangladesh as well.He was followed by another military ruler, Husain Muhammad Ershad, who copied Zia's policy almost in all the sectors. Zia and his political party BNP decided to capitalise on anti-India sentiments and minimise the gap between Bangladesh and China.Later, when Zia's widow Khaleda Zia came to power, she followed her husband's path. During her second-term, from 2001 to 2006, China-Bangladesh relations reached a new height.In 2002, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was warmly received in Bangladesh as the countries signed nine bilateral agreements. Seeing the body language of the relations, many Bangladeshis satirically uttered that another Zia has appeared, as the Chinese Premier's last name sounded 'Jia'. Anyway, both the countries at that time declared 2005 as the 'Bangladesh-China Friendship Year'.In 2002, China and Bangladesh signed a defence cooperation agreement, which covers military training and defence production. BNP is the main political rival of Awami League, the present ruling party. BNP has been trying to establish pro-Pakistani policy in Bangladesh and both BNP and Pakistan had always been Chinese picks.So, China knew the discontent of the Awami League. That is why they are trying to appease the Sheikh Hasina government as best as they can. It is also unfortunate that Bangladesh is now a major buyer of Chinese weapons.The relation between two countries is always appreciable. But the way the Chinese are trying to get in is highly risky for Bangladesh politics. China eyes The Belt and Road Initiative to be fully successful. To do that, China sees Bangladesh as a very important country. But once the Chinese goal is achieved, it will work for the BNP and pro-Pakistani forces. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina should keep this in mind. We can humbly suggest her not to forget the past and not to forget that the China influx is not serene.(Mohshin Habib is a senior journalist based in Dhaka.

"Islamabad:

Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan, who arrived here on a three-day official visit, met Pakistan President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday and signed several agreements and agreed to speed up the projects under the USD 60 billion CPEC to further cement the bilateral all-weather ties.

President Alvi also conferred its highest civilian award Nishan-e-Pakistan on Wang, 70, a member of the ruling Communist Party of China鈥檚 (CPC) powerful Politburo Standing Committee.

The senior Chinese leader was received at the airport by Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and other top officials.

During delegation level-talks between Prime Minister Khan and Vice President Wang, a number of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for cooperation in different sectors were also signed between the two countries, the government said in a statement.

鈥淭hese MoUs include cooperation in economic and technical affairs, Disaster Management and assistance in agriculture sector of Lasbella University,鈥?it said.

Khan and Wang were present during the signing of the MoUs.

The two leaders also launched and unveiled the plaques of four mega development projects in the fields of energy, technology and education under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the statement said.

Khan and Wang also inaugurated the Confucius institute at the University of Punjab. The institute will impart Chinese education, promote cultural exchanges and other activities, it said.

The visiting Chinese leader also attended a special seminar about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Wang will visit Lahore tomorrow after completing his meetings in Islamabad, it said.

The Chinese Vice President鈥檚 visit underscores the vitality of the time-tested and all-weather relationship between Pakistan and China. His visit will reinforce the strength of bilateral ties and impart further impetus to the growing, multi-faceted cooperation between the two countries in diverse fields, it said.

The visit is in continuation of high-level exchanges between the two countries, which have acquired an increased momentum since Prime Minister Khan鈥檚 visit to China in November last year and his participation in the 2nd Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in April this year.

Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said in Beijing that Vice President Wang鈥檚 visit to Pakistan will further deepen high-level exchanges, friendship and mutual trust between the two countries.

He said the visit will also advance the development of the CPEC besides bilateral cooperation across the board.

Lu said China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners and iron friends, and firmly support each other on issues concerning each other鈥檚 foreign interests.

He said Pakistan has been a priority on China鈥檚 diplomacy and now both the countries have witnessed a sound momentum in their cooperation and frequent high level exchanges.

Lu said both the countries are deepening the mutually beneficial cooperation and conducting close coordination in international and regional affairs.

The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan鈥檚 Balochistan with China鈥檚 Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of the Belt and Roads Initiative (BRI).

After visiting Pakistan, the Chinese leader will also visit Germany and Netherlands.

"Beijing: In an unusual move, China Tuesday issued a travel alert for its citizens visiting the US, warning them of harassment and public security issues in the country as bilateral ties touched a new low amid a spiralling trade war.

The warning came a day after China cautioned its students against going to the US for studies.

China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Tuesday issued the travel alert for Chinese tourists travelling to the United States which could hit the American travel industry badly.

Noting the frequent occurrence of shootings, robberies and theft in the United States recently, the ministry warned Chinese tourists to fully assess the risks of travelling to the US.

Chinese tourists are asked to learn about the information about the public security situation and related laws and regulations of tourist destinations, to raise safety awareness and step up precautions to stay safe, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The travel alert is valid until the end of this year.

Last year, the number of Chinese tourists visiting the US fell for the first time in 15 years, after more than a decade of rapid growth, amid the trade friction between the two countries.

The two countries have been locked in an escalating conflict over trade for the past year. The conflict increased in recent months as Washington has tightened trade restrictions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.

Hopes for an imminent trade deal were shattered in May after the Trump administration more than doubled tariffs on USD 200 billion of Chinese imports and threatened additional duties.

Defending the travel alert, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a media briefing here that ""China made this decision in response to current circumstances"".

Asked whether the measure which could hit US travel industry is part of the escalating trade war between the two countries, Geng said, ""Chinese people travelling to US encountered various difficulties during the entry and after entry. They were interrogated and harassed by law enforcing agencies. So it is only necessary for us to issue such a notice.""

He said China had issued similar warning to students and scholars.

""They (US authorities) falsely claim that the Confucius institute is a tool to exhort political influence. They falsely accuse Chinese scholars of espionage and harassed them,"" he said.

""For example, the US placed visa restrictions on many Chinese student scholars. They revoked some visas. Recently they revoked a 10 year-visa for Chinese scholar to US,"" he said.

""I would like to emphasise that we hold active attitude for normal people-to-people exchanges. But it should be based on mutual respect,"" he said.

China on Monday warned students and academics on the ""risk"" of studying in the United States, citing an uptick in visa denials and delays.

According to official data, about 4.58 million Chinese have gone abroad to study since 1998 and 3.22 million of them have returned. About 3.63 lakh Chinese students reported to have enrolled to study in the US last year."
"The Baluchistan Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the attack carried by a woman suicide bomber inside the University of Karachi campus in southern Pakistan on Tuesday that killed three Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver.

The Chinese fatalities included the director of the Chinese-built Confucius institute, which offers Chinese language graduate classes, and two teachers. The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan confirmed the deaths of three Chinese teachers and one teacher injured in the 鈥渢error"" attack and urged the Pakistan government 鈥渢o make every effort to treat the wounded, conduct a thorough investigation of the attack, and severely punish the perpetrator.""

The Pakistan Foreign Ministry in a statement condemned the attack and the killing of Chinese in Karachi. 鈥淭he cowardly incident is a direct attack on the Pakistan-China friendship and ongoing cooperation,"" it said and added authorities were investigating the incident to apprehend the culprits and bring them to justice.

The militant group based in Balochistan province has targeted Chinese nationals in attacks in the past.

Here鈥檚 Everything That We Know So Far

The mineral-rich region of Baluchistan borders Afghanistan to the north, Iran to the west and has a long coastline on the Arabian Sea. It has Pakistan鈥檚 largest natural gas field, is believed to have many more undiscovered reserves and precious metals including gold. Separatists have called out the unfair exploitation of the region鈥檚 resources leading to decades of insurgency in the province.

The Baluchistan Liberation Army, which has also called for independence from Islamabad, has mainly targeted Pakistani security forces, but in recent years they have also focused on attacks against Chinese interests, due to Beijing鈥檚 increasing economic footprint in the region.

Thousands of Chinese workers are living and working in Pakistan, with most of them involved in Beijing鈥檚 multi-billion-dollar One Belt One Road Project. The Gwadar Port in Baluchistan province鈥檚 linking with China鈥檚 Xinjiang province is the main feature of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor due to its strategic location near the Strait of Hormuz - a crucial oil shipping route in the Arabian Sea. A Chinese company also operates a major gold and copper mine in Balochistan.

The Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) stated that it attacks Chinese nationals because Beijing has ignored its warnings on not to enter deals and agreements regrading the region before the province had been 鈥渓iberated"".

The group鈥檚 statement following Tuesday鈥檚 attack identified the bomber as Shari Baluch or Bramsh, saying she was the group鈥檚 first female bomber. The attack marks 鈥渁 new chapter in the history of Baluch resistance,鈥?the statement said.

The BLA has also claimed attacks in Karachi including the Pakistan Stock Exchange Building in 2020 and the Chinese consulate in 2018.

The group demands that all Pakistani security forces withdraw from Balochistan and has suggested negotiations in the presence of an 鈥渋nternational guarantor"".

The militant group has claimed a number of major attacks in recent months, including a simultaneous storming of two paramilitary bases in Balochistan earlier this year. Most of the attack by the group take place in Balochistan or in Karachi.

The group was led by Balach Marri, scion of an influential Baloch family. Security officials have said Marri was killed in Afghanistan in 2007, where he had established a base and hideout. After initial setbacks due to Marri鈥檚 death, the militant group has accelerated its attacks, particularly in the last year.

The Baluchistan Liberation Army says it is currently led by a man named Bashir Zeb Baloch. While little is known about the group鈥檚 commander-in-chief, the organisation said that its 鈥淔idayees"" (guerrillas) are made up of young, educated Baloch disillusioned by hardship and being sidelined from economic development.

The Pakistan Taliban also known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan had claimed responsibility for an attack on a bus that killed nine Chinese nationals and four Pakistan nationals in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province last July. The Pakistani Taliban are a separate group from the Afghan Taliban, their allies who have seized power in neighboring Afghanistan.

This is the beginning of the new chapter in Balochistan freedom movement with Shari Baloch sacrificing herself for the cause of her qaum leaving behind a great future and 2 small kids. This is really sad that she was pushed into taking such extreme step! https://t.co/LZ7EE2FMqZ 鈥?Alok Bhatt (@alok_bhatt) April 26, 2022

She joined the self sacrifice squad of the BLA's Majeed Brigade two years back. The BLA said that she had been offered the option to opt out of the squad because of her two young children. She however refused. The BLA has threatened to target more Chinese nationals and China's interests in Balochistan.

China asks its firms in Pakistan to heighten security for staff after Karachi suicide attack: Official

oi-PTI

Beijing, Apr 28: China on Thursday asked thousands of its nationals working on the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects in Pakistan to increase their security and watch out for terrorist risks following a deadly suicide blast in Karachi that killed three Chinese and wounded another.

""The Pakistani government has promised to strengthen security for Chinese personnel, projects and institutions, and will not allow any force to undermine our friendship and cooperation,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here.

Asked about the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the militant group whose woman suicide bomber carried out the attack at the Karachi University targeting the Chinese teachers, warning more attacks if China and Pakistan don't vacate from Balochistan province, he said that Pakistani government ""will not allow any force to undermine our friendship and cooperation"".

""We believe Pakistan will take earnest and concrete measures to ensure the safe and smooth progress of bilateral cooperation. Once again, we remind our institutions' personnel in Pakistan to heighten their security awareness and watch out for terrorist risks,"" he said.

A woman suicide bomber was seen on the video blowing herself near a shuttle bus used by Karachi's Confucius institute occurred on Tuesday afternoon, killing three Chinese teachers and their local driver and injuring another Chinese person. In a purported video issued by the group, a BLA spokesman said that the motive of the attack was very clear.

""It was a simple and clear message to China and Pakistan to withdraw immediately from Balochistan,"" said the masked spokesman surrounded by armed men on a hilly terrain. ""Baloch Liberation Army guarantees you the CPEC will fail miserably on Baloch land,"" the spokesman, who was holding an assault rifle, said in fluent English.

He warned that a special unit has been formed particularly to attack Chinese officials and installations in Balochistan. The group opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, especially in the restive Balochistan, saying local people do not benefit.

The CPEC connects China's Xinjiang province with Gwadar port in Balochistan, providing China direct access to the Arabian Sea. Thousands of Chinese are currently working on scores of infrastructure projects.

The Pakistan Army has formed a separate brigade consisting of thousands of soldiers to guard the Chinese as both the BLA and the Pakistan's Islamic militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have carried out numerous attacks.

Wang said, ""the Pakistani side is making all out efforts to investigate the attack and apprehend the perpetrator. Terrorism is a common scourge of all mankind. China and Pakistan has the resolve and capability to cut off the claws of the terrorists make them pay the due price.""

He reiterated that China and Pakistan's iron-clad friendship is deeply rooted in people's hearts. ""China supports Pakistan's national development and will continue to support its economic and social development and improvement of livelihood."" State-run Global Times reported that Chinese businesses are ramping up precautions to ensure the safety of personnel and projects in accordance with official guidelines following the Karachi attack.

After the attack, several state-owned companies that are deeply involved in Belt and Road projects in the country told the daily that their local employees are safe and the projects have not been disrupted. The daily on Thursday also carried excerpts of the BLA threat, saying that the woman suicide bomb attack has socked both the Chinese and Pakistanis.

""The violent attack targeting Chinese teachers has shocked people in China and Pakistan and the international community,"" the report said. ""There used to be threats from terror groups toward Chinese nationals in Pakistan. But it is rare to see such barefaced threats soon after such a violent and heinous terror attack,""

Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, told the daily. Qian said that by taking pictures of the attacker, quickly announcing responsibility, making further threats and hyping related topics, the BLA is promoting terrorist propaganda to maximize the influence of the terror attack.

The information of the bomber, if confirmed, and the terror attack in the University of Karachi showed the BLA's targets are wider and there have been changes in the structure of their leading group, said Zhou Rong, a senior researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. The total number of the BLA may not exceed 6,000 and its Majeed Brigade has less than 500 people, he said. Zhou said the attack showed young people with higher education and humble origins in Balochistan may be replacing the older leaders of the province.

Compared with senior members, who are tribal leaders and may yield to the Pakistani government and military, these young people are more stubborn and make more varied attacks that are hard to prevent, Zhou said. In the Karachi terror attack, both terrorist and victims were teachers. The joining of women with higher education to the BLA shows how bewildering the extremist group can be, said Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies in Lanzhou University.

Wang Shida, deputy director of the South Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania Research Institute, said Pakistan's security has not covered smaller CPEC projects leaving the Chinese nationals vulnerable. Facing the BLA and other forces' rampant attacks, Pakistan should build a comprehensive security mechanism on all Chinese personnel and projects as soon as possible, Wang said.

The two major issues - religious extremism and separatism - remain big problems for the Pakistani government. Aside from cooperating with China on countering terrorism, the Pakistani government also needs to improve the education of the public to help them avoid being easily coaxed and incited by terrorists, Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Centre for Afghanistan Studies in Lanzhou University, told the daily.

Karachi: A terror attack in Pakistan鈥檚 metropolitan city Karachi has claimed lives of Chinese and Pakistani nationals, in what is being seen a targeted attack on Chinese nationals in the country.

As per details, the blast occurred outside the Karachi university campus of IBA (Institute of Business Administration), in a vehicle parked outside the campus building with at least three Chinese nationals and a driver aboard.

The blast set ablaze the parked vehicle in flames, killing the three Chinese nationals 鈥?one male and two females, and a driver in what is now being suspected as a targeted suicide bomb attack, carried out by a burqa-clad female bomber.

The killed Chinese nationals include Zhang Xiaoping, director of a Chinese language institute of IBA called Confucius institute. The other two female Chinese nationals were also part of the faculty of the same institute.

Police authorities, the rangers and the bomb disposal squad cordoned off the area and later confirmed that the explosion in the vehicle was a terror attack.

鈥淐lear marks of ball bearings can be seen on the vehicle, which confirms that it was a terror attack. It can also be seen that one side of the van is more damaged, which also signifies that the attack may have been done by a suicide bomber who exploded after reaching close to the vehicle from one side,鈥?said an eye witness.

It can also be seen no crater emerged in the ground, which also clarifies that the attack was not done through an improvised explosive device.

Police authorities say that investigation is being done and forensics will be taken along with the CCTV footage of the institute to ascertain the actual cause of the blast.

The attack has been claimed by Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a banned terror group operating out of Balochistan province in Pakistan.

The attack was carried out by a Baloch female suicide bomber, who belonged to the Majeed Brigade.

鈥淭he mission was carried out by first female fidayee of the Brigade. Fidayee Shari Baloch alias Bramsh today added a new chapter in Baloch resistance history,鈥?read a press release issued by BLA.

鈥淢ajeed Brigade of Baloch Liberation Army accepts responsibility of today鈥檚 self-sacrificing attack on Chinese in Karachi,鈥?the BLA press release added.

After the explosion, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah contacted the police chief. The IGP informed the Chief Minister that the blast took place inside a van near the Commerce Department of the university.

The chief minister also ordered the Karachi commissioner to submit a report on the bombing.

This is a first attack by a female suicide bomber from the BLA in Pakistan, adding massive concerns over the security situation in the country, which has seen a major surge in terror attacks by various terror organisations including the Baloch separatists and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

China鈥檚 increasing influence, investments and presence in Pakistan has also been questioned and criticised by Western powers and has been targeted by various terror organisations in the past.

The latest attack targeting Chinese nationals raises serious security concerns and challenges for Pakistan鈥檚 security forces."

Islamabad: Shari Baloch, a 31-year-old mother of two, reportedly became the first woman to carry out a suicide bombing for the secular, ethnic Baloch rebels seeking independence for Pakistans largest and resource-rich province of Balochistan.

She killed three Chinese citizens and their Pakistani driver in front of the Confucius institute in Karachi on April 26, RFE/RL reported.

The attack raised questions about what motivated an educated, happily married, middle-class woman to blow herself up. Many in Pakistan wonder whether the attack signifies a new direction for the two-decade-old Baloch insurgency that is locked in a violent stalemate with Islamabad, the report said.

Kiyya Baloch, an exiled journalist covering Balochistan, says the first attack by a female suicide bomber heralds the possibility of similar attacks in the future.

鈥淚t is a paradigm shift because until recently, the Baloch nationalists prided themselves in being secular and opposed to the kind of radicalization that results in extreme violent acts such as this one,鈥?he said.

Kiyya Baloch says a wide-ranging Pakistani crackdown that has included military operations, forced disappearances, and even extrajudicial killings of the insurgency鈥檚 supporters fuels extreme desperation among those affected by the abduction or killing of their loved ones, RFE/RL reported.

鈥淏oth the state and the Baluch insurgents have adopted extreme positions,鈥?he told RFE/RL.

鈥淭he state appears unwilling to give up its security-centric approach to Balochistan as it continues to prop up an artificial political leadership (in the region). On the other hand, the insurgents have been radicalised to an extent that they are now resorting to suicide bombings.鈥?
Since 2000, Baloch rebel groups have been engaged in conflict with the Pakistani security forces in the vast southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran and hemmed in by the Arabian Sea.

Islamabad blames the rebels for attacks on government forces, installations, immigrants, and labourers from the eastern Punjab Province and even pro-Islamabad Baluch figures.

Baloch nationalists and human rights watchdogs accuse Pakistani security forces of grave human rights violations by adopting harsh methods such as forced disappearances and killings to crush the insurgency.

Continuing violence during the past two decades has transformed the insurgency. It began as a tribal rebellion but has evolved into a handful of shadowy groups now attracting educated, middle-class Baloch professionals, the report said."
"Glare on Confucius institutes which are increasingly being seen as a propaganda arm of Beijing

People in Shimla pay tribute to the Indian Army soldiers who were martyred during the standoff at the China border in Ladakh

Reacting to media reports that the Indian government has decided to review Chinese language training in higher educational institutions 鈥?particularly in Confucius institutes run by Hanban (an affiliate of China鈥檚 education ministry) 鈥?Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong urged New Delhi to stop politicising normal cooperation.

China on Tuesday registered its protest over India joining a clutch of countries and universities across the world that are reviewing or closing down its Confucius institutes which purportedly offer Chinese language and cultural programmes overseas but are increasingly being seen as a propaganda arm of Beijing.

鈥淲e hope Indian relevant parties can treat Confucius institutes and China-India higher education cooperation in an objective and fair manner, avoid politicising normal cooperation, and maintain healthy and stable development of China-India people-to-people and cultural exchanges,鈥欌€?he said.

The decade-old agreement for exchange programmes between Indian and Chinese institutions have been under the scanner for the last few months; predating the recent tensions with China.

In October last year, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had written to all universities; making it mandatory for them to take clearance from the foreign and home ministries before entering into any agreement with Chinese institutions for academic exchange.

Stepping up pressure, the human resource development ministry is understood to have written last week to the two universities which have set up Confucius institutes 鈥擴niversity of Mumbai and Vellore Institute of Technology 鈥?asking them for details

of activities undertaken there for review by the government. The Telegraph sought details from the HRD ministry about the nature of this review but did not get any response.

Making a case for continuing with the Confucius institutes in India, Rong pointed out that these institutions addressed the growing demand in India for Chinese language teaching.

鈥淐hina-India cooperation on Confucius institute Project has been carried out for more than 10 years. All Confucius institutes were established by the Chinese and Indian universities after signing legally binding cooperation agreement in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, friendly consultation, equality and mutual benefit, and on the premise that the Indian side applied voluntarily and met the conditions for running the institute.

鈥淭he school-running mode of Confucius institutes has always been 鈥榝oreign side mainly managing, Chinese side assisting and both sides raising funds jointly鈥?

Over the years, Confucius institutes have played an important role in promoting Chinese language teaching in India and China-India people-to-people and cultural exchanges,鈥欌€?the embassy spokesperson said.

While any kind of action against China is being welcomed in the face of Chinese incursions along the Line of Actual Control, B.R. Deepak, chairperson of the Centre for Chinese and South East Asian Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, said study of language, culture and civilisation should be encouraged, supported and promoted irrespective of India鈥檚 benevolent or malevolent relationship with the immediate neighbour.

鈥淎merica and Japan have many differences with China but they have never stopped studying about China. In India, we are latecomers in China studies, which resulted from our knee-jerk reaction in the wake of the 1962 conflict with China. It was from 1964 onwards that we started seriously integrating Chinese language with studies for the first time when the Centre for Chinese Studies was established in Delhi University with funding from Ford Foundation. Since then many such centres have come up. I believe they should be promoted, supported and encouraged as capacities are built over a period of time,鈥?he said."

As time-honoured civilizations, India and China share lots of similarities. Because of this, the two nations are often compared in terms of politics, economy, culture and other spheres. However, the co-existence of the two cultures is not that commonly seen.

But here in a university in Vellore, Indians and Chinese each show their fascination for the other.

Chinese students in India

Since 2005, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) has cooperated with Chinese universities to admit students from China. It has admitted more than 450 Chinese students. About 200 undergraduates and graduates from China are studying at VIT. It currently has MoUs with 14 universities in China, including key Chinese universities such as Sichuan University and Wuhan University. Students choose to study here because of the reasonable expenditure, good placements and their fascination for India.

Liu Wei is a second-year undergraduate in Computer Science from Wuhan University. She enjoys a reputation as 鈥淪ister S鈥?among other Chinese peers as she gets 鈥淪鈥?in almost every subject.

Like Liu Wei, many Chinese students find courses at VIT highly intense with numerous exams. 鈥淚n China, we have lots of exams. But it鈥檚 much less compared to what we have here. Once the exam starts, it goes on for a long time.鈥?Chinese peers also find their Indian counterparts studying very hard. 鈥淭o prepare for exams, they study overnight.鈥?Admitting that the education system is exam-orientated, they say that the good side is one can learn efficiently and quickly.

Apart from studying, Chinese students travel during vacations. One of the students was invited to his classmate鈥檚 home in Delhi. 鈥淎lthough I had to get used to different traditions, it鈥檚 really an unforgettable experience,鈥?said Yang Siyuan, a second-year undergraduate in Computer Science.

Most students here consider finding placements in China. A small number of students choose to stay in India, especially in Mumbai. Those who want to pursue further studies after graduation prefer destinations such as the U.S., Hong Kong, and so on.

Chinese students coming to study at VIT first attend a three-month language course to improve their English. 鈥淢y English was very bad before I came here. Now I can manage in class,鈥?Li Guangyu said.

Living on campus is not that difficult for Chinese students. They have air-conditioned dormitories and Chinese canteens. But quite a few still choose to dine in the Indian canteens. Those who do not get used to the food in India cook Chinese food.

Indians learning Chinese

VIT set up a Chinese language centre in partnership with HANBAN, also known as Confucius institute (a non-governmental public institution affiliated to the Ministry of Education of China) in April, 2009. There鈥檚 a Chinese Proficiency Test (HSK) centre at VIT. The China Director, Dr. Sun Peng, is a history professor from Zhengzhou University. Last year, more than 100 people registered for the course. During the winter break last year, HANBAN sponsored top 20 students who passed the exam to travel in China. 鈥淚ndian students are so excited. They can鈥檛 wait to share their experience in China,鈥?one of the Chinese volunteers said.

There are different levels of Chinese courses. The entry level of Chinese offered at the centre is free for VIT students. Normally, students are divided into two groups and have classes spanning one-and-a-half hours from Monday to Friday. Some Chinese students serve as volunteers at the centre to teach students at primary level under the guidance of the Chinese teacher. Apart from students, some professors at VIT and businessmen register for the course. Several Chinese cultural events are held in the university such as the Chinese New Year celebrations and Namaste China.

The popular Tamil festival Pongal goes on from January 14 to 17. Grand celebrations are held in many universities. Chen Chen and his girl friend Zhang Qian, an MBA student, also joined the grand college celebrations with other Indian students.

Tomsk, an ancient Russian city tucked away amid endless Siberian forests and swamps, would seem an unlikely place to spearhead Russia's technological revolution. Yet, it is from here that science and technology is staging an impressive comeback. In the coming years, Tomsk, known for its hydrocarbons and iron ore resources, may emerge as the innovation capital of Russia.

Russian leaders have announced the goal of transforming the resource-dependent economy into a knowledge-based economy. While today oil, gas and minerals account for 80 per cent of Russia's export earnings, by 2020 the share of innovative industry is set to grow from five per cent to 30 per cent. The government funnelled $25 billion into Research and Development in 2010 and plans to more than double the funding over the next 10 years. President Dmitry Medvedev, who made innovation a focus of his tenure, last year signed a plan to build a futuristic high-technology research hub on a thousand acres of wasteland in Skolkovo outside Moscow. Even as the construction of the multi-billion Russian version of the Silicon Valley gathers momentum, a high-tech economy is up and going 3,000 km away in Tomsk.

Enormous potential

What makes Tomsk special is its enormous scientific potential. It is home to Siberia's oldest university, set up in 1888. Today, the city boasts of 25 academic and research institutes, six universities and 16 other schools of higher education. The city of 500,000 residents has nearly 100,000 students, drawn from all over Siberia and other Russian regions, as well as from 14 foreign countries.

Russia has been traditionally strong in academic research but weak in applications, with the notable exception of defence technologies. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the situation worsened as the economy nosedived in the course of a painful transition to free market. Over the past decade, the Russian economy has bounced back, growing 10-fold to a $2 trillion GDP. But it remains heavily reliant on commodities. However, the picture is beginning to change.

Tomsk was the first among Russian regions to adopt a strategy of innovative development. In recent years, the local government has built a ramified network of business incubators, venture funds and technology transfer centres to facilitate the commercialisation of a vast treasure trove of academic research. The high point of this effort was the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) that offers considerable tax breaks, exemption from customs duties and other benefits to companies specialising in nanotechnologies, IT, electronics, biotechnology and medicine. A nuclear cluster will be added to the Tomsk SEZ next year, when the previously secret military nuclear facility, Seversk, will be converted into a civilian research centre. The Tomsk tech-town is still in its early stages but its 57 tenants have already come up with some amazing world class innovative products.

Elecard, a top world manufacturer of video codecs, whose customers include Microsoft and Sony, has developed, jointly with another Tomsk company, Triaxes 鈥?a technology to convert 2D films into 3D format and to shoot glasses-free 3D content with stereoscopic cameras used today for filming movies which are seen with glasses on.

The Tomsk-based firm, Mikran, has teamed up with Nokia Siemens to produce LTE base stations for Russia's first 4G network. The company supplies electronic equipment to Indian telecom and defence sectors, and manufactures critical transmit/receive modules for phased array radars deployed on Russia's latest MiG-35 fighter planes.

A new gearing technology developed by the CJSC 鈥淭echnology Market鈥?allows for the construction of smaller size gearboxes with higher load capacity, longer life and greater efficiency than any existing gearings.

Some high-tech products of the Tomsk SEZ have special relevance for India. A revolutionary nano-filter, AquaVallis, purifies 100 per cent biologically polluted water and does not require any further disinfection. It features higher flow rate, longer cartridge life and lower cost per unit of filtered water, and is ideal for countries like India. The filter was displayed at a Russian national exhibition in New Delhi in 2008 but no Indian firm showed any interest in the product.

A wound nano-dressing developed by Tomsk scientists not only heals all kinds of burns and inflammations much faster than traditional bandages but is also effective in fighting hospital infection and drug-resistant bacteria 鈥?the curse of modern medicine.

A replica

Tomsk offers a glimpse of what Russia may look like in 10 or 20 years. Its economy, traditionally shaped by hydrocarbons, timber and defence industries, is a scaled replica of the Russian economy. The commodity sector still dominates but the region's 400 innovation driven enterprises contribute 20 per cent to the gross regional product. Tomsk plans to double the share in the next few years.

A number of foreign companies have set up shop in Tomsk to tap its rich natural and intellectual resources. India is represented by ONGC Videsh Ltd which in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, an oil company that has production assets in the Tomsk region. However, daunted by harsh climate and challenging terrain conditions, the company has considered pulling out. Tomsk Governor Viktor Kress, a strong advocate of closer business ties with India, tried hard to make OVL stay.

鈥淚 am aware that the OVL has opened talks with [Russian oil company] Bashneft for selling the Imperial Energy, but we would like them to carry on. I'm sure they will overcome their problems and expand operations in our region; we can offer them more oil blocks,鈥?Mr. Kress told The Hindu during a recent press tour of Tomsk by Moscow-based foreign media. He expressed the hope that more Indian companies would come to Tomsk.

鈥淲e would like to cooperate with India in not only hydrocarbons. We invite Indian businessmen to join our SEZ. We have developed a range of technologies that Indian companies may find very useful.鈥?
Foreign business is indeed discovering the taste of the new Tomsk economy. Japanese, Singaporean, Taiwanese, Australian and European companies have settled in the SEZ but Indian companies are conspicuously absent from the region's high tech sector. Tomsk's trade with India stands at just over $1 million, which is 0.1 per cent of the region's foreign commerce.

India's low visibility in Tomsk is in stark contrast with the high-profile presence of China focussed on the rich pool of local talent. There are about 1,500 Chinese students enrolled at Tomsk universities, mostly in engineering faculties. The Confucius institute has been operating at the Tomsk State University since 2008, offering Chinese language training to Russian students and running several language classes for schoolchildren. A number of leading Chinese universities have cooperation agreements with Tomsk universities that provide for regular exchange programmes and joint research. The prestigious Tomsk Polytechnic University has been invited to open a branch in the Liaoning Province of northeastern China. Tomsk has similar partnership arrangements with the Japanese, German, French, Australian and other foreign universities. Again, there are no Indian varsities among Tomsk partners. Some time ago, Tomsk signed a cooperation memorandum with Mumbai, but it is still too early to say whether it will make any difference.

Local India fans make their best to compensate for the lack of interest on the part of Indian government and business. There are half-a-dozen Indian dance groups which offer classes in classical and Bollywood styles to enthusiasts, give concerts and make the Indian presence felt at various cultural events. Moreover, Tomsk dancers have extended their reach far beyond their region to cater to the growing interest of Russians in India and its culture. One of the best known groups, Satvika, has set up a 鈥淏haratanatyam school in Siberia鈥?offering week-long intensive courses to groups and individuals prepared to travel hundreds of kilometres to Tomsk to get initiated in the ancient art of Indian dance.

Right time for India

It is rather unfortunate that Russian cities like Tomsk are low on India's radar screen. This probably betrays a widespread but outdated view of Russia as being little more than a source of energy and commodities for India's booming economy. It was a misconception 10 years ago, and is even more so today. In the 1990s, Indian business missed a chance to gain a foothold in the Russian up-and-coming manufacturing industries such as automobile, food and tobacco. Today, it has an opportunity to catch up by joining Russia's innovation push. Now is the right time to enter the burgeoning market of Russian high-tech. On the one hand, the Russian government is pouring money into cutting edge technologies while, on the other, Russian business is yet to develop an appetite for innovation, with just 10 per cent of companies investing in innovation.

鈥淲e are inviting Indian business to come and set up joint R&D centres with Tomsk companies in IT, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies and other priority areas for both our countries,鈥?says Governor Kress."
"New Delhi: A bomb blast in a Karachi market on Thursday killed one person and injured 13, four of whom are serious. The blast is believed to have been carried out by the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA).

This was the second attack in Karachi in just a fortnight. An earlier blast on April 26 was carried out by Shari Baloch, a female suicide bomber of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), that killed three Chinese teachers of the Confucius institute and their Pakistani driver in the Karachi University.

Geo News reported that emergency was imposed in public hospitals in Karachi after the bomb attack, which also damaged half a dozen vehicles.

The local police said that the locally-made bomb was planted in a motorcycle and contained ball bearings. A vehicle belonging to the Pakistani Coast Guard was damaged but the individuals in the vehicle, as well as the driver, are safe.

Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, who visited the site of the blast said: ""There is a terror threat not only in Karachi but across the country"", adding that those responsible for the blast will be caught.

Pakistani authorities have not pointed out any organisation for the blast as yet.

However, Sindh is in the crosshairs of nationalist groups from both Balochistan and Sindh, who have been carrying out attacks in Karachi, known as Pakistan's financial capital. Local rebel outfit SRA had joined hands with Baloch rebels to form the umbrella group -- Baloch Raaji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS) to fight for independence for both the provinces.

The SRA has been carrying out a low-intensity campaign against the settling of ""outsiders"" in Sindh, alleging that the Pakistani government is carrying out demographic changes. In April this year the SRA had carried out blasts at railway tracks in the Hyderabad division of Sindh. Numerous local organisations have been voicing their discomfort at Afghans and Pushtuns being relocated to Sindh.

The Sindhis have also been voicing their complaint at Chinese investment in their province, which began in late 2020 after former president Imran Khan's government promulgated the Island Ordinance to allow some of the largest Sindh islands to be given to China for redevelopment.

Another grouse among the Sindhi groups is the acute scarcity of water in their province, which they allege is because of the large network of dams and canals on the river Indus. Sindhi groups allege that many of these large hydropower projects are being carried out by China to benefit Pakistan's Punjab with water and power at the expense of Sindh."
"RSN Singh

Two recent incidents are reflective of the growing jihadi and insurgent role of women in Pakistan. On 26 April a Baloch lady teacher turned into a human bomb and killed three Chinese and a Pakistani driver in Karachi, and barely a month before, a two girl students egged on by their teacher, in an all girls school in Dera Ismail Khan, bled another teacher to death by slitting her throat for alleged blasphemy.

The suicide bombing was not Pakistan inspired, but Balochistan centric. It was addressed to the economic and cultural concerns of Balochistan rather than Pakistan.

These two incidents need to be discussed in detail because weaponisation of women in Pakistan for political, geopolitical and religious reasons and objectives is likely to compound the ethnic and religious volatility of Pakistan with reverberations in the subcontinent and even beyond.

The name of the Baloch suicide bomber was Shari Baloch. She owed allegiance to the Majeed Brigade of the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). She was a young mother of two children. Her husband is a dentist, and father a respectable government servant. She was a teacher with impressive array educational degrees to her credit i.e. masters in education, a masters in zoology and a M Phil degree as well, and yet she volunteered to be a suicide bomber. Her targets being the three Chinese teachers of the Confucius institute in Karachi University.

Earlier the BLA selected only those targets which were associated with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), but this time it was the perceived cultural ingress by China. In the wake of the suicide bombing, the BLA issued a statement that it will not brook economic, cultural and political expansionism by China in Balochistan. The suicide bombing therefore was not Pakistan inspired, but Balochistan centric. It was addressed to the economic and cultural concerns of Balochistan rather than Pakistan.

Unlike the rest of Pakistan, especially Punjabis, the Baloch in general, invariably had geopolitical alignment totally at tangent with the central dispensation. The Baloch have always treated the central government as colonial dispensation. Tribal Islam in Balochistan has been in total dissonance with the jihadi Islam of rest of Pakistan.

The alienation rather hatred of the Balochis for Pakistan can be construed from the lack of any remorse at the loss of the Pakistani driver in suicide bombing. The strategic and geopolitical imperative of China for Pakistan, particularly the military is not shared by the Balochis, hence they do not want to be burdened by the economic and strategic weight of the CPEC. Also, while rest of Pakistan which includes the fundamentalists and Islamists, may view China with anti India and anti Hindu prism, the Balochis are not driven by this psychology.

Ever since the creation of Pakistan the Ahmediyas and Shias have been incessantly targeted by the State backed radical Sunni outfits.

The anti India and anti-Hindu component in Pakistan's and some quarters of 57 member OIC in their approach to China came to the fore in the recent meeting of the foreign ministers of the Islamic body held in Islamabad. 46 countries and 800 delegates participated and hammered their concern on Palestine and Kashmir. In addition they discussed Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Syria, but there was not a whisper on the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China. A substantial time was devoted on the growing Islamophobia in non-muslim parts of the world. To get to the roots of the phenomenon, Pakistan has to look only within. Ever since the creation of Pakistan the Ahmediyas and Shias have been incessantly targeted by the State backed radical Sunni outfits. Ahmediyas are treated as sub-humans and Hazara Shias are being forced to flee the country in search of safer homes. Even the Sunnis are at each other's throat to prove who is a truer muslim, manifesting in the endemic blasphemy killings. Pakistan therefore is the most Islamophobic country in the world.

Very significantly the foreign minister of China, Wang Yi, was present as a special guest during the meeting. This was the first time that a Chinese FM had been invited to the OIC conference. The FM of Pakistan went to the extent of saying that the participation of the Chinese FM was a propitious indication of $400 mn investment by China in Muslim countries under the Belt Road Initiative (BRI). Infact Pakistan has been trying to act as the bridge and facilitator for extension of the Chinese strategic and geopolitical influence in the Islamic world.

The anti India, anti-Hindu and may be anti West notions are inherent in this outreach and facilitation by Pakistan. The territory of Balochistan is critical part of this bridge which the Balochis are resisting tooth and nail. For the Balochis the problem is getting more acute in the backdrop of the fact that China is wooing Afghanistan to become part of the BRI.

China appears to be more than determined to fill the strategic vacuum in Afghanistan created by the American withdrawal and also because of the current global focus on the conflict in Ukraine. The foreign minister of China, Wang Yi visited Afghanistan undeterred by any human rights concerns about his hosts. The other two countries to have sent their foreign ministers to Kabul are Qatar and Pakistan.

This latest attack by a burqa clad female suicide bomber is an epoch making event with deeper and wider portends for the territorial integrity of Pakistan.

It is rather revealing that China has been attacking the very foundations of Islam in dealing with the Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang province, yet jihadi countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan are so beholden to the Chinese communist dispensation. In this there is a lesson for India, i.e. it pays to be steadfast and firm in national philosophy and direction. The world community, takes such countries seriously, but in case a country is seen wavering in national ideology and nationalism as such, it sends confused signals, and engenders inimical forces internally and externally.

The action by the BLA's female bomber was motivated by ethnic Baloch nationalism. Earlier in 2018 the BLA had attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi but amongst those killed, there were no Chinese. In 2017, a Chinese man and woman, engaged in teaching Chinese language, were abducted and killed. These were violent assertions of Baloch nationalism, but this latest attack by a burqa clad female suicide bomber is an epoch making event with deeper and wider portends for the territorial integrity of Pakistan. The Pakistani dispensation understands this very well, that is why Shahbaz Sharif personally visited the Chinese embassy to placate and reassure the Chinese.

It is quite a contrast from the July 2021 incident wherein ten Chinese officials, mostly engineers were killed and 26 injured in a bomb attack on a bus ferrying them to the site of 4320 MW Dasu Hydroelectric Project, in Kohistan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. That it was a terrorist attack鈥?the Pakistani authorities were in denial for a very long time, however, subsequently they agreed to pay a compensation of $ 11.6 mn. This World Bank funded project is not part of the CPEC. Whether this was for jihadi reasons or ethnic reasons is not known, but one thing is certain that large segments of Islamic terrorist groups active in Pakistan, specially the pan-Islamist ones, do not share the same enthusiasm about China as the Pakistani dispensation.

In 2007 Musharraf ordered attack on the Lal Masjid in Islamabad at the behest of China because the jihadis operating from the masjid had abducted and killed some Chinese nationals running a massage parlor. Amongst those killed were more than a dozen Uighur muslims, members of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement(ETIM).Therefore the deafening emphasis by China and Pakistan, that their friendship is 鈥渉igher than Himalayas, deeper than ocean, sweeter than honey and stronger than steel鈥?is heavily burdened on the latter, almost like colonial relationship. Obviously then, there are bound to be fundamentalist constituencies in Pakistan who resent this relationship as it blunts the Islamic agenda and image of Pakistan, the very basis of its elusive nationhood.

Till now only the male jihadis were the perpetrators who hunted for the victims, but now it seems, the women are getting as brutalized as their male jihadi counterparts.

As discussed the impetus behind the Shari Baloch suicide bombing was Baloch nationalism, but the brazen killing of a 21 year school teacher in an all girls school at Dera Ismail Khan was motivated by Jihad and driven by Pan Islamism and Islamophobia. What smites the human heart is that the killers were girl students, egged on by another lady teacher. Together they slit the throat of the victim and bled her to death. The victim was accused of blasphemy and the assassins maintained that the orders for the assassination came directly from Prophet Mohammad by the medium of dream of 13 year old girl relative of one of the perpetrators.

Such blasphemy killings have become routine in Pakistan nevertheless, till now only the male jihadis were the perpetrators who hunted for the victims, but now it seems, the women are getting as brutalized as their male jihadi counterparts. If this phenomenon persists, Pakistan will completely inhabited by jihadi beasts, because the sobering influence of the fairer sex would have disappeared. That even after 1400 years, even after creation of Pakistan 鈥?a homeland for Muslims 鈥?the hunt for 鈥榖lasphemers' amongst muslim continues unabated, demands serious and in-depth study.

It is impossible for such radicalized societies to co-exist with other communities and faiths. Such monochromatic societies are bound to implode."
"Balochistan conflict requires a political solution

BY MANISH RAI

For decades the Pakistani establishment has termed the Baloch insurgency as a low-intensity conflict confined mostly to

Balochistan, the country's largest province by territory. But that seems to have changed, as a spate of attacks that

have taken place this year clearly demonstrate that insurgency has entered into a crucial new phase. Despite Pakistani

security forces claiming an intensive crackdown on rebels, the insurgency's lethality has increased many folds in

recent times.

As a result, more ferocious attacks, such as suicide bombings, high-profile targeted attacks, and kidnappings of

high-ranked army officials are now shaping the course of Pakistan's oldest separatist insurgency. Especially since the

start of this year, a remarkable shift in the strategy of Baloch militants has been evident. This year started with a large-

scale attack in January on a security checkpoint in Balochistan's Kech region that borders Iran.

Less than a week later, another bold attack was carried out by the militants from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA)

suicide wing (the Majeed Brigade). In these attacks, militants stormed two security camps in Balochistan's Nushki and

Panjgur districts. Most of the time, figures of opponent casualties provided by the military and militants are difficult to

independently verify. But the latest string of organized attacks has undoubtedly rocked not only Balochistan but the

whole country. In addition to carrying out bold and daring attacks, Baloch insurgents are also using more modern

weaponry than Pakistani security forces.

In April, this year the BLA's first female suicide bomber, Shari Baloch a research scholar and school teacher

attacked China's Confucius institute in the southern port city of Karachi, killing four, including three Chinese nationals.

This was a dramatic shift in the strategy as it aimed to expand the Baloch conflict to Pakistan's major urban centers.

Also following this strategy Baloch Nationalist Army (BNA) carried out a bomb blast in a busy Lahore business district,

killing three persons and injuring over 20. Another new tactic was seen in mid-July when a Pakistani army Lieutenant

Colonel was kidnapped by the BLA's Special Tactical Operations Squad while on a holiday trip in the hill station of

Ziarat in Balochistan. After this, kidnapping the Pakistani army launched the operation to rescue their senior officer.

But the military could not release its kidnapped officer before he was killed.

Shockingly an unprecedented claim in the first week of August was made by the spokesperson of Baluch Raaji

Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), an umbrella group of four separatist Baluch groups. Claiming to shoot down a Pakistani military

chopper in Balochistan's Lasbela district. Pakistan Army media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) quickly

rejected this claim and termed it as false propaganda. But, again in the month of September, a helicopter belonging to

Pakistan Army Aviation Corps crashed near Balochistan's Harnai district. Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that its

cadres had shot down the helicopter while it was on a rescue mission. The Army confirmed the downing of the chopper

but didn't give any specific reason for the crash. The claims of the Baloch militants can't be verified but there is a high

possibility that they now possess some form of anti-aircraft capabilities.

After the US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year large quantities of highly sophisticated weapons which were used by

Afghan security forces have made their way to the region's black markets. Many of these US-made weapons have ended

up in the hands of Baloch armed groups as well like- M16A2 and M16A4 assault rifles, Trijicon ACOG optics, and M203

under-barrel grenade launchers. In addition to small firearms and RPG-7 pattern rocket launchers, Baloch insurgents are

using various machine guns like PK(M) and MG3 variants.

Sometimes insurgents have also been spotted using some heavy machine guns (HMG). Baloch armed groups have

gradually moved towards consolidation of what was previously a fragmented insurgency. Over the last few years,

insurgent groups have either merged or have formed tactical alliances to put up a united fight against the Pakistani state.

By doing this they were able to have a better pool of resources and better coordination to carry out complex operations.

Also, the leadership of the armed groups has shifted from Tribal chiefs to the well-educated and highly motivated Baloch

middle class. And these new ranks of Baloch insurgents are transforming the insurgency into guerrilla warfare.

It's a hard truth that with time, the Baloch insurgents have adopted fighting tactics very much similar to Tehreek-E-

Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Pakistan policymakers have to understand that Baloch armed conflict can't just be dealt with

by military means. Balochistan requires a political solution that can only be achieved through talks. Currently, if the

Pakistani state is willing to talk and negotiate with the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) then why not follow this approach with

Baloch armed groups as well? Until Islamabad meets some of the demands of the separatist movement the insurgency

will continue to grow for sure.

The recent turn in India-China relations and events in Nepal surprised many but not those who know that China plans 50 years ahead and kept track of developments 鈥?joining the dots as they emerged. In fact, Nepal should be a case study how China plans. Mao Zhedong had famously said, 鈥淭ibet is the palm of China and Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and NEFA (read Arunachal Pradesh) are its fingers.鈥?In a recent media interview Lobsang Sangay, President of Tibetan government-in-exile recently warned Nepal that after occupying Tibet, China is looking to accomplish its 鈥楩ive-fingers plan', adding 鈥淐hina is driving a wedge between centuries-old Indo-Nepal relations to quietly colonise the Himalayan country.鈥?China has already soaked Nepal communists in red dye. How did China achieve this?

With Nepal priding itself the only Hindu Kingdom in the world, China knew conquering this finger wouldn't be easy. Mao found the answer in a communist revolution. An article in Debka files of 2002 reads, 鈥淭he Maoist insurgency in Nepal may be one of the last surviving operations of a little known Chinese intelligence organ known as the Ministry of Foreign Liaison, a body of CCP set up in Mao Tse Tung's time. This ministry recruited and supported mostly Third World extremist Maoist groups, such as in Nepal 鈥?Burma 鈥? Philippines 鈥ambodia, Japanese Red Army, and 鈥?in Peru. Not all those revolutionary movements survived. One that did is the Nepalese Maoist Communist Party of Nepal. Chinese intelligence infiltration operations into Nepal, that began decades ago, set off a self-perpetuating Maoist 鈥淧eople's War鈥?that has never really ended. It would be in China's interests to install a regime in Kathmandu that is not too friendly with the US or India.鈥?
Mao was China's President from September 1954 to April 1959. His Ministry of Foreign Liaison must have set its sights on Nepal in early 1955 鈥?some 65 years ago. The bloody Maoists insurgency (also termed Civil War) was launched by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) against the Nepalese Government on February 13, 1996 with the stated purpose of overthrowing Nepal's monarchy and establishing a Peoples Republic. It ended with the Comprehensive Peace Accord on November 21, 2006. Notably, Pushpa Kamal Dahal (alias Prachanda) wanted the armed rebellion to be launched in 1991 but lacked consensus. The insurgency resulted in deaths of over 17,000 and internal displacement of hundreds of thousands; characterized by massacres, purges, summary executions, kidnappings and worst of crimes against humanity 鈥?on same lines what Mao had perpetrated in China. On June 1, 2001, King Birendra of Nepal and most of the royal family were massacred. Crown Prince Dipendra was accused of the killings. He 鈥榮upposedly' died on June 4, 2001.

China actively cultivated two Nepalese Maoist leaders of the civil war 鈥?KP Sharma Oli (present Prime Minister of Nepal) and Prachanda. Both have flourished under Beijing's tutelage and are indebted to China. Oli was first arrested in 1970 for subversive politics and later imprisoned for 14 consecutive years (1973-1987). He has served as Prime Minister from October 11, 2015 to August 3, 2016. Prachanda was part Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) during the Maoist insurgency. Now from Nepal Communist Party (NCP), he has been Prime Minister twice 鈥?2008-2009 and 2016-2017. In between his two premierships, Prachanda had told Nepalese media, 鈥淭he ultimate war will be with the Indian Army鈥? Visiting China when not Prime Minister, he was still accorded welcome as 鈥楬ead of State' in Beijing. In February 2018, Oli vowed to stop Nepalese from joining Indian Army. It is evident both Oli and Prachanda parrot what Beijing wants.

India and Nepal have historical cultural relations. Some six hundred thousand Indians are in Nepal presently and more than seven million Nepalese are in India, serving in Indian Army, police, private sector or otherwise residing in India. India pays US$12 billion annually to Nepal-origin pensioners from Indian Army (80,000), Assam Rifles (17,000) and 11,000 widows of soldiers. Total bilateral trade in 2018-19 reached INR 57,858 crore (US$ 8.27 Bn). Both countries have a Power Exchange Agreement since 1971 for meeting power requirements in border areas. Some 150 Indian ventures operating in Nepal are engaged in manufacturing, services (banking, insurance, dry port, education and telecom), power sector and tourism industries. Total economic assistance earmarked under 鈥楢id to Nepal' budget in FY 2019-20 was INR 1200 crore.

China began constructing the 770 kms railway connecting Lhasa with Nepal's border town of Khasa in 2007. A Nepalese military delegation visiting India in 2013 sought assistance to establish a Think Tank in Kathmandu was only promised technical assistance, no funds. Very next year China's Confucius institute in Kathmandu University co-established by Hebei University of Economics and Business, with full support from Office of Chinese Language Council International. Post the two-month blockade of India-Nepal border in 2015, Oli signed Trade and Transit Treaty with China in 2016 during his first premiership, giving Nepal access to seven Chinese seaports and dry ports. The blockade was an economic-humanitarian crisis 鈥?Indians in Nepal witnessed four km long lines for fuel, non-availability of medicines and severe food shortages. Nepal was pushed closer to China for which it accused India. Nepalese financial system was also affected by sudden Indian demonetization.

Nepal has committed nine projects to China's BRI: Kathmandu-Kyerung Railway; Madan Bhandari University; Galchi-Rasuwagadhi-Kerung 400 KV Transmission Line; 762 MW Tamor hydropower project; 426 MW Fukot-Karnali Picking run-of-the-river hydropower project; upgrading Rasuwagadhi Highway; Tokha-Chahare road; Kimangthan-Hile road, and; road connecting Dipayal with Tibet. Over 90 percent of total FDI in Nepal comes from China since past three years. One example of Chinese FDI in Nepal is the Hongshi Shivam Cement, a joint partnership between Hong Kong Red Lion No 3 Cement Co Ltd (70 per cent), wholly owned subsidiary of Hongshi (China) and Shivam Cement Pvt Ltd, Nepal (30 per cent). Another US$ 140 cement factor is in the process of being set up by China.

China has gripped Nepal with hard and soft power. PLA soldiers in uniform were observed in northern Nepal in areas bordering Tibet known to have uranium deposits as early as 2014. China deployed PLA in these areas to grab uranium exploration and block Tibetan refugees. Such PLA deployment also catered for nibbling Nepalese territory which is happening already but in connivance Nepalese communists. Nepal cannot stand up to Nepal anyway I bigger nations don't. About 500-600 Nepalese army personnel are presently under training in China. China provides scholarships to scores of Nepalese students, as also sponsors study tours for hundreds of Nepali civil servants, security personnel, politicians, civil society members, and journalists annually. Large number of Chinese tourists visit Nepal every year 鈥?1,50,00 visited in 2018. Mandarin is now mandatory in Nepal's schools with the teachers coming from China who will imbibe anti-India sentiments in upcoming generations.

China has become major player in Nepali politics and the economy especially after it managed to combine the two major communist parties in Nepal and bring them to power. In May 2020 there were signs of split between Oli and Pracahnda but Beijing managed to broker truce between the two. Events moved rapidly after this China's behest; new Nepalese map claiming three Indian territories, Nepal deploying armed police on its border with India, firing on Indian nationals inside Nepal, Nepalese army chief visiting the border with Pithoragarh (India) to establish border posts, anti-India broadcasts by Nepal Radio, move to amend Constitution of Nepal to curb Madhesis citizenship rights and the like.

Unconfirmed reports indicate Oli government has agreed in principle to allow China deploying 3000 PLA personnel in Kalapani area under garb of Nepalese army. China's ultimate aim would be to establishing itself along India-Nepal border in conjunction the Nepalese army assisted by Pakistan's ISI to threaten India's northeast. It was on Chinese behest that erstwhile Pakistani Prime Minister visited Nepal and presently Imran Khan is jumping with joy to support Oli. ISI has been operating from Nepal against India for long and has intensified activities in wake of the India-China standoff. The security establishment has noticed increase in presence of ISI-backed groups along India-Nepal borders. Few years back, four Chinese nationals were caught coming across with fake Indian documents on a mission to meet Naga rebel groups. On July1, 2020 two Chinese of Tibetan-origin were caught coming via Nepal; one a special agent of People's Armed Police integral to PLA and the other with links to Indians in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. The implications are clear with many that can come through the porous borders.

Our policy makers are sanguine about India-Nepal military-to-military relations as also our cultural relations. But it is the government that matters; military and public have little say 鈥?same as in Sri Lanka. Immediate attention is needed to the India-Nepal border. As for the current Oli-Prachanda rift, apparently latter feels left out of the limelight. China will try its best to broker peace between the two, possibly through top-level power sharing deal like in Israel and Afghanistan. If the Oli government stays as part of power sharing or by itself, we may witness a China-Nepal Extradition Treaty for Tibetans. China would want this immediately as a sequel to America's bill to recognize Tibet.

We must acknowledge that communists of Nepal have sold their country to China even if not yet completely. Any government in Nepal will need support of communist parties. If our foreign policy, national security advisors and R&AW find themselves stumped with the rapid turn of events, fault is ours. We need to face realities and plan accordingly on long-term basis like China."
"Jayadeva Ranade

There is an excellent song by Frank Sinatra called I've got you under my skin! China's leadership seems to feel just that way about US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

His comments, especially those aimed at the Chinese Communist party, have rattled the cage!

Pointed remarks by senior US officials, especially Pompeo, about China's Communist ideology being a threat and the US sanctions targeting specific Chinese Communist party officials involved in formulating, or implementing, harsh repressive policies against the Uyghur minority in the Xinjiang-Uyghur Autonomous Region or Hongkong, are aimed at the Communist party.

It particularly renders vulnerable those party members with assets illegally stashed in the US or abroad, or have close relatives studying there.

More worrying for Communist party members is the possibility that they 鈥?and maybe their families 鈥?will be banned from getting US visas.

Almost 70 per cent of Communist party members at and above the department level have their children studying in the US!

Exhibiting the concern and worry in China's leadership echelons, the Communist party's People's Daily on August 25, published a lengthy, three full-page 34,000- character (Chinese) article that listed a barrage of criticisms against Pompeo.

It was a response to his speech on July 23, 2020, at the Richard Nixon presidential library in California.

The article contained a point-by-point rebuttal of 26 statements selected from Pompeo's speech.

To facilitate international dissemination the English-language China Daily (August 28 鈥?September 3, 2020) reproduced the Xinhua report, which was the basis for the People's Daily article, under the caption 鈥楩act check on Pompeo's speech鈥?

It covered an entire five printed pages.

The first two paragraphs claimed he had 鈥榯otally negated China-US relations, maliciously attacked the leadership of the Chinese Communist party and China's political system, drove a wedge between the Chinese Communist party and the Chinese people, and made groundless accusations on China's domestic and foreign policies.'

It accused Pompeo of spreading the 鈥楥hina Threat Theory' in an attempt to forge an international anti-China alliance and contain China's development.

Charging that Pompeo's remarks ignored 鈥榟istory and reality, are full of strong ideological prejudice and a Cold War mentality', it affirmed that the Chinese people had condemned Pompeo's remarks and that 鈥榬ational people' in the US and the international community had also criticised them.

Of interest are the first two points in the People's Daily article.

Dismissing Pompeo's charge that the Chinese people are not the same as the Chinese Communist party, it retorted that the party has no special interests of its own and 鈥榓lways regards the happiness of the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as its original intention and mission'.

It represents 鈥榯he fundamental interests of the most people in China'; everything is for the people, the people are supreme in everything; and the CCP has led the Chinese people to win independence, freedom and liberation, and made great achievements in the development of the country.

The second point affirmed that the people are the foundation of the Communist party and are its blood.

The Communist party is the 鈥榗hoice of history and the people'.

It highlighted that in the 99 years since its founding, the party had grown from around 50 to 91.914 million party members by the end of 2019 and is now the world's largest party that 鈥榟as long been in power in the world's most populous country'.

鈥榃ithout the Communist party, there would be no new China' is the common belief of the Chinese people.

Trusting the Communist party of China is the mainstream public opinion in China.

China's Guangming Daily on August 31 published an article under the caption 鈥榃hy 鈥榃orst Secretary of State in American History' Gets Its Name鈥? which referred to a recent Washington Post article.

It enumerated that he had ignored the severity of the epidemic, evaded his own political responsibility, refused international cooperation, and tried to 鈥榯hrow away' China, etc.

It ended with the observation that 鈥榮ince the end of World War II' perhaps 鈥榥o one has performed worse than Pompeo'.

Notwithstanding this sharp personal criticism, US pressure on China continues.

A statement issued by the US Department of State on September 2, 2020, mandates that henceforth senior Chinese diplomats in the United States will need approval to visit university campuses and meet local government officials.

Cultural events with an audience larger than 50 people hosted by the Chinese embassy and consular posts outside of mission properties will also require approval.

The statement added that action will be taken to ensure that all official Chinese embassy and consular social media accounts are properly identified as Chinese government accounts.

The announcement that Confucius institutes will be shut down by the year's end will have a major impact on China's propaganda and 鈥榠nfluence operations'!

On September 1, Pompeo accused the Chinese-government funded Confucius institutes of working to recruit 鈥榮pies and collaborators' at US colleges.

鈥業'm hopeful we will get them all closed out before the end of this year,' the US secretary of state said.

In August, Pompeo had labelled the centre that manages the Confucius institutes in the US as 鈥榓n entity advancing Beijing's global propaganda and malign influence' and required it to register as a foreign mission.

This will be a major blow to China which has spent $2.17 billion on the Confucius institutes between 2006 and 2016.

It had hoped to expand the number of Confucius institutes from 525 in 146 countries to 1,000 Confucius institutes by 2020.

According to the Confucius institute's annual development report 2017, these institutes processed more than 1.7 million students and 621,000 registered online students by 2017.

Such criticism by China of a foreign government official, particularly of a major power like the US, is very unusual.

However it is clear that China will come under increasing pressure certainly till the US presidential elections are held.

"Karachi: At least four people, including two foreign nationals, were killed and several others injured on Tuesday when a car exploded inside the premises of the University of Karachi in Pakistan鈥檚 financial capital, media reports said.

According to initial reports, the blast took place in a van near Confucius institute in the university.

Local media reports said that the van was transporting lecturers including two foreign nationals who were returning after teaching at the university. These lecturers were apparently teaching at the Chinese language department.

Four people including two foreign nationals were killed in the blast, reports said.

Videos of the van in which the blast took place were also posted on social media with flames of fire completely destroying the vehicle as police and paramilitary rangers reached the scene immediately and cordoned off the areas.

Urdu language Jang newspaper reported that the blast was caused by a remote controlled device.

Police sources said that there were seven to eight people in the van; however, an exact number of casualties has yet to be reported. PTI CORR ZH AKJ ZH ZH

President Xi Jinping has said that China should give a 鈥榝ull play鈥?to capital by focusing on its 鈥榩ositive role鈥? Xi was speaking at a meeting of the Politburo on Saturday.

Despite underscoring the importance of capital, Xi did try to warn people about letting private capital flow like 鈥榳ater鈥?

鈥淐apital is like 鈥榳ater鈥? Laissez-faire will lead to disaster; timely and reasonable guidance can benefit one party. Correctly understand and grasp the characteristics and behavioural laws of capital, comprehensively improve the efficiency of capital governance, and educate and guide capital entities to practice the core socialist values,鈥?said Xi during the Politburo meeting.

Xi鈥檚 remarks come when China鈥檚 economy is in the doldrums as the central government is trying to shore up factory production. But people haven鈥檛 forgotten Xi鈥檚 common prosperity programme, which was at the front and centre of ensuring equitable growth of the Chinese economy. Though common prosperity has slowly disappeared from press releases and Xi鈥檚 statements. Common prosperity wasn鈥檛 even mentioned in the Chinese version of the Xinhua story, but it was there in the English language version of Xi鈥檚 remarks.

It is becoming difficult to justify the direction of Xi鈥檚 鈥榗ommon prosperity鈥?campaign as business leaders have started speaking up about the health of the Chinese economy.

Weijian Shan, founder and chair of one of Asia鈥檚 biggest private equity investors, has criticised the Chinese government鈥檚 economic policies, resulting in a 鈥渄eep economic crisis鈥?on the scale of global financial crash.

Weijian isn鈥檛 the only business executive who has spoken up. Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, has said that Beijing鈥檚 zero-Covid policies are slowly destroying the economy.

鈥淭he current lockdown is even more extreme than in early 2020, and the economy is crashing almost as hard. Freight traffic volumes in the Shanghai metropolitan area plunged by 81% year-on-year in the first three weeks of April,鈥?said Wuttke in an interview.

It is still rather rare for business leaders like Weijian and Wuttke to speak in the fashion they have done.

The attack on Confucius institute in Karachi has left the Chinese public looking for answers. Three staff members who died in the attack were Huang Guiping, who once served as deputy dean of the School of Foreign Languages at Sichuan Normal University; Ding Mufang, a teacher; and Chen Sai, a volunteer teacher. Another Chinese national, Wang Yuqing, sustained injuries but survived the attack.

The hashtag 鈥淧akistan Confucius institute shuttle bus hit by the terrorist attack on campus鈥?was viewed 16.1 million times on Weibo. Pakistan鈥檚 president made a special visit to the Chinese embassy in Islamabad to share his condolences. A related hashtag was viewed 24 million times on Weibo.

Chinese state media published an article by Pakistani authors blaming British colonisation as the root cause of the Baloch secessionist movement.

The tensions between the US and China are often articulated in a statement by unnamed official sources, but a stark example was revealed this week.

A viral video showed a PLA fighter bomber pilot named Gao Zensong ready to 鈥減ull the trigger鈥?to 鈥渆xpel鈥?a foreign vessel in the South China Sea.

鈥淚 am the air force of the Chinese People鈥檚 Liberation Army. You have entered the control area of the Chinese air force. Please leave immediately. Otherwise, you will be responsible for the consequences,鈥?Gao said in the video broadcast by state-run CCTV. The video was viewed 50 million times on Weibo.

On 27 April, the PLA spokesperson said the Chinese navy had expelled the guided-missile destroyer USS Sampson, which had sailed through the Taiwan Strait a day before.

Chinese internet censors find it particularly difficult to digest criticism from celebrities and influential business leaders.

The social media presence of Wang Sicong, son of Chinese property magnate Wang Jianlin, was scrubbed from the Chinese internet. Wang, who had 40 million followers on Weibo, openly criticised the government鈥檚 Covid policies in Shanghai, including the use of China鈥檚 state-sanctioned medicine for treating the disease.

The Chinese foreign ministry has announced that it would be willing to allow some Indian students to return.

The US officials held 鈥渢op-level talks鈥?with their UK counterparts over reducing the chances of China launching a war against Taiwan, according to the Financial Times.

鈥淥ne of the people said the Taiwan meeting spanned everything from how the UK could do more diplomatically with Taipei to discussions about boosting deterrence in Asia. It also included talks about what role the UK would play if the US ended up in a war with China over Taiwan,鈥?Financial Times reported citing unnamed sources.

Despite a slight lull in India-China relations, things haven鈥檛 yet entirely resolved themselves.

India鈥檚 Enforcement Directorate on Saturday announced that they had seized Chinese telecom giant Xiaomi鈥檚 assets worth Rs 5,551 crore under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

The directorate said that Xiaomi was making remittances to three foreign entities, one of which was a Xiaomi entity. The directorate has alleged that Xiaomi hasn鈥檛 availed any services from the entities to which the royalty payment was remitted. Xiaomi India has been under the ED鈥檚 investigation since February.

鈥淲e have studied the order from government authorities carefully. We believe our royalty payments and statements to the bank are all legit and truthful,鈥?Xiaomi India said.

鈥淲estern countries such as the US and Europe have a set of rhetoric for China鈥檚 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

"The suicide blast targeting a van with Chinese faculty near Karachi University鈥檚 Confucius institute was an attack on China鈥檚 soft power. The terrorists seemed aware that the institute symbolised China鈥檚 cultural and civilisational expression, and that China, more than others, was keen to project a soft image.

Secondly, the terrorists used a woman suicide bomber to draw greater international attention and increase the impact. This has triggered a debate on the changing dynamics of the Baloch insurgent movement.

As expected, the reaction from China was strong: the Chinese foreign ministry said that those behind the incident would have to pay the price. The statement will increase the pressure on the Pakistani government. This time, Pakistan reacted to the attack in a more coherent manner than in the past. When terrorists belonging to the banned TTP attacked a bus carrying Chinese workers near the Dasu dam site in 2021, the then government had tried to cover up the facts, declaring the incident was due to a technical fault in the vehicle. It was only because of Chinese pressure that the government changed its stance and allowed Chinese investigators to help the Pakistani agencies investigate the attack. In contrast, following the Karachi University blast, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif rushed to the Chinese embassy to express his condolences and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice.

Mr Sharif鈥檚 gesture may be appreciated by China, but to address Chinese concerns about security, the state institutions here will have to take measures that can satisfy Beijing. This is also essential for the smooth implementation of the CPEC projects.

Pakistan has already invested a large amount of money in protecting Chinese nationals and securing CPEC projects. A Special Security Division was created in 2016. It comprises two light infantry divisions (reportedly, the first was created in September 2016 and the second in 2020), with 15,000 troops each. The SSD also has support from 32,000 security personnel forces of the Frontier Corps, police and Levies, apart from a dedicated intelligence network to prevent or neutralise terrorism-related threats.

The Chinese companies working on CPEC-related projects are satisfied with the security measures, as the Global Times, a state-owned Chinese newspaper, recently reported. However, the cost of security, to which China contributes, is very high.

Secondly, the entire approach to safeguarding CPEC is very conventional and mainly based on protecting the work sites and escorting convoys of engineers and workers. Chinese companies remain apprehensive about the security of their staff in major urban centres. Many Chinese working in Pakistan in small industries, such as restaurants and the manufacturing sector, do not get proper security cover.

The cost of security is also a major factor that makes CPEC projects more expensive. According to a media report, Pakistan has again postponed the approval of a Rs36 billion project meant to provide security to Chinese nationals engaged in the construction of the multibillion-dollar ML-I project. The latter is a mega project requiring a large security blanket. Besides, managing, training and screening of security personnel is also a critical aspect about which the Chinese are concerned.

Conventional security for CPEC projects is essential, but state institutions cannot ignore the strategic and political context. Cursing external elements alone cannot solve the problem. There is also a need for deep introspection and a review of approaches. A thorough review is required of Pakistan鈥檚 policy towards the Afghan Taliban, who have not fulfilled any expectations related to terrorism threats in Pakistan emanating from across the border. The proscribed TTP are enjoying the full patronage of the Taliban regime, who give them access to the weapons left behind by Nato forces. Similarly, Baloch insurgents are still using Afghan soil to hide and to hatch terrorist plots against Pakistan.

The causes of unrest in Balochistan are well known and have been repeatedly discussed on these pages and elsewhere. State institutions are experimenting with selective measures 鈥?ranging from reconciliation to amnesty 鈥?to address the problem of insurgency. However, nothing has gone well because all such initiatives are poorly designed, and the purpose has been to isolate the insurgent leadership rather than bring fighters back to normal life. The security establishment is engaged in a broader dialogue with the Baloch people, especially the youth. It is important to understand the perspectives on the ground. But first, it should lead to a change in approach, and second, political actors should also initiate such processes. Like the other provinces, Balochistan deserves a free and fair election, and this is crucial to creating a dialogue.

Fulfilling this demand won鈥檛 cost much, and would, in fact, be a great leap forward in addressing the grievances of Balochistan and reducing insecurity for Pakistanis and foreigners in the country. If the state is sincere in isolating and demoralising the insurgent movement in the province, it will have to address the issue of the Baloch missing persons. Every suspect involved in terrorism and anti-state activities will have to be brought within the orbit of the rule of law. The judiciary will have to be efficient and decide such cases on a priority basis to give the message that justice is being done.

After ensuring this, the state institutions will have to focus on enhancing their analysis skills. No doubt, Baloch militancy has become a more lethal movement and is indigenising itself because of the current leadership of its groups. The Balochistan Liberation Army鈥檚 Majeed Brigade has become notorious for using lethal tactics with an element of surprise. The quick changes in its operational strategies make the job of law-enforcement agencies difficult. After the Karachi attack, the probability of using female fighters and suicide bombers in more complex guerrilla operations has increased. The law-enforcement agencies need to be vigilant. There is a need to study the tactics and strategies of the terrorist organisations across the world; the BLA is not averse to adopting the tactics of the religious terrorist groups as long as these serve its purpose.

"A day after Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed 鈥渄eep concern over the attacks on its citizens in Pakistan鈥? Sindh Police arrested a suspected terrorist in Karachi Thursday. The suspect, identified as Afzal Lund, alias Aafi, had allegedly planned to kill a Chinese doctor in Hyderabad, according to a news report in Dawn. The arrest came in the backdrop of Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif鈥檚 recent two-day visit to Beijing.

The safety of Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan was one of the issues on the agenda of the prime minister. At least four Chinese nationals have been killed in targeted attacks in Karachi this year. And it鈥檚 not gone down well in Beijing.

Xi sought a 鈥渞eliable and safe environment鈥?during his talks with Sharif. There鈥檚 a lot riding on the safety of Chinese nationals in Pakistan and the projects backed by Beijing, including a $10 billion rail project.

Aafi was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Department of the Sindh Police. According to reports, he had completed the recce mission in Hyderabad but was arrested before he could carry out the attack.

He is also associated with an attack on three Chinese nationals in Karachi in September. In the same month, a man, posing as a patient, had opened fire on a dental clinic in Karachi, leaving two Chinese citizens injured and one dead.

It wasn鈥檛 the first targeted attack in Pakistan to send alarm bells ringing in both countries. In April 2022, three Chinese teachers were killed in a suicide attack outside the Confucius institute at University of Karachi. According to reports, the attack by a highly educated female suicide bomber aimed to undermine a $65 billon-project involving roads, railways, and ports in Pakistan.

CCTV footage of the attack showed a woman detonating herself outside the entrance of the institute when a van carrying staff members reached the area. The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) had claimed responsibility for the attack. They also released a video warning China to leave Pakistan.

In 2020, a suicide bomber attacked a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese ambassador in Quetta. While the ambassador was unharmed, four people were killed. In July 2020, 13 people, including nine Chinese workers, were killed when the bus they were travelling in was hit by a bomb.

Karachi, Apr 26 (PTI) A burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber struck a van inside Pakistan's prestigious University of Karachi, killing three Chinese nationals and their local driver, in the latest targeted attack against Chinese citizens in the country's financial capital.

The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) linked Majeed Brigade claimed responsibility for the attack on the teachers that took place near China-built Confucius institute - a non-profit institute teaching Chinese language to local pupils - in the university. It said the attack was carried out by a woman suicide bomber.

A spokesperson for the university said that three of the victims were Chinese nationals. They were identified as Confucius institute Director Huang Guiping, Ding Mupeng, Chen Sa and Khalid, the Pakistani driver.

The spokesperson added that two others, including Chinese national Wang Yuqing, and Hamid were injured in the blast.

""Academic activities and public dealings will remain suspended at KU on Wednesday to mourn the loss of the Confucius institute's faculty members,"" he said.

Counter-Terrorism Department official Raja Umar Khattab said that the suicide attack was carried out by a woman, adding that ball bearings were found at the site of the blast, Dawn newspaper reported.

He said the van was properly guarded as a Rangers team was escorting it.

Four Rangers who were behind the van on motorcycles were also injured. However, their condition is stable.

CCTV footage of the attack showed a burqa-clad woman standing outside the entrance of the Confucius institute. The woman detonated herself just as the van neared the institute's entrance.

A spokesperson of the BLA, the separatist outfit which is banned in Pakistan, the UK and the US, said that the attack was carried out by Shari Baloch alias Bramsh - the ""first female suicide bomber of the brigade"". The attack marks ""a new chapter in the history of Baloch resistance,"" he added.

A picture of the bomber in circulation showed the woman along with her two small kids.

In a purported video issued by the group, a BLA spokesman said that the motive of the attack was very clear.

""It was a simple and clear message to China and Pakistan to withdraw immediately from Balochistan,"" said the masked spokesman surrounded by armed men on a hilly terrain.

""Baloch Liberation Army guarantees you the CPEC will fail miserably on Baloch land,"" the spokesman, who was holding an assault rifle, said in fluent English.

He warned that a special unit has been formed particulary to attack Chinese officials and installations in Balochistan.

The group opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, especially in the restive Balochistan, saying local people do not benefit.

Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency. Baloch insurgent groups have previously carried out several attacks targeting the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.

Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon said that it was unfortunate that teachers had been targeted.

Asked whether a threat had been issued prior to the attack, the senior officer said that there was ""always a threat"".

He said tight security arrangements were already in place at the varsity.

Senior police official Muqqadas Haider earlier said that the explosion took place at the van's right side at the institute's entrance.

Urdu language Jang newspaper reported that the van was bringing the foreign nationals who used to teach Chinese at the IBA institute inside the Karachi University from their guesthouse when the blast took place.

Videos of the blast-hit van were also posted on social media with flames of fire completely destroying the vehicle as police and paramilitary rangers reached the scene immediately and cordoned off the area.

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed the Counter-Terrorism Department and SSP East to immediately reach the site of the incident. He also asked the Karachi commissioner to submit a report.

He later visited the Chinese Consulate where he briefed Consul General Li Bijian about the blast.

The chief minister assured the Chinese official that the incident would be fully investigated, a statement issued by the CM's office said.

""Those involved in the incident will be brought to justice. We value the services rendered by Chinese experts in the country and the province,"" Shah said.

""Some elements do not like the partnership between the two countries,"" he said, adding that the miscreants behind the incident would be dealt with an iron hand.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the blast and assured Shah of the Centre's full help and cooperation in dealing with such incidents.

""The prime minister said that terrorists are [the] enemies of Pakistan. He vowed to eliminate the remainder of terrorists through collective efforts and unity. He directed for the provision of the best medical facilities to the injured,"" the PMO said.

""My heartfelt condolences go to the bereaved families. I strongly condemn this cowardly act of terrorism. The perpetrators will surely be brought to justice,"" the prime minister said on Twitter.

Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack. ""Sindh police will soon get to the bottom of the incident,"" he said, adding that the perpetrators would be punished.

He called for steps to be taken to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens.

The Foreign Office spokesperson condemned the attack, offering condolences and sympathies to the families of victims.

""We strongly condemn the reprehensible terrorist attack in Karachi which claimed innocent lives, including those of Chinese nationals working at the Confucius institute,"" he said.

It added that the ""cowardly incident is a direct attack on the Pakistan-China friendship and ongoing cooperation"".

""Pakistan and China are close friends and iron-brothers. Pakistan attaches great importance to the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects and institutions in Pakistan,"" it said.

This is not the first time Chinese nationals have been the target of terror attacks in Karachi, which is Pakistan's biggest city and economic hub.

"Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the Pakistan Senate Defence Committee, stated that China's confidence in Islamabad was shaken after the Karachi suicide bombing incident. 鈥淚t has caused serious concern and understandable indignation in China. More so, the pattern of attacks is so recurring and it is clear that Pakistani promises of 鈥榝oolproof security鈥?are mere words, not matched by countermeasures on the ground,鈥?he said in an interview to Dawn. 鈥淚f such attacks continue, not just Chinese but other foreign investors will be forced to review their role in Pakistan,鈥?he said

An explosion triggered by a burqa-clad woman suicide bomber from the Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) ripped through a van of the Confucius institute at the prestigious University of Karachi on April 26. This was the latest targeted attack against Chinese citizens in Pakistan.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he would review security arrangements for the Chinese nationals working in the country. In view of potential threats being faced by the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and other joint ventures between the two countries, the prime minister would assess all the mechanisms earlier devised for ensuring the security of the Chinese nationals and the new plan being made by the planning and interior ministries.

Earlier in July 2021, a bus carrying Chinese workers in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa had come under attack leaving 10 Chinese nationals dead and 28 others injured. China, the key investor in Pakistan, has demanded that Islamabad should take action against those involved in them.

Kotnis was among the five-member medical team that went to China in 1939 in response to a call seeking medical assistance during the second Sino-Japanese War.He worked tirelessly in China for four years, before he passed away at the young age of 32. Touched by Kotnis鈥檚 work in China, Mao, a master calligraphist himself, penned a moving tribute and condolence message to his family in Solapur.The 3-foot-long letter was written on traditional rice paper using charcoal black ink. A few years ago, the letter was handed to the Kotnis museum operated by the municipal corporation.The condolence message had undergone wear and tear over the years and plans to restore it began in 2014 when the then Chinese consul general in Mumbai heard about this gem.鈥淭he chief of relics from China visited Solapur and discussed ways to restore the letter.

He also asked the Karachi commissioner to submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the blast and assured Shah of the Centre's full help and cooperation in dealing with such incidents.This is not the first time Chinese nationals have been the target of terror attacks in Karachi, which is Pakistan's biggest city and economic hub.In July last year, masked armed men on a motorcycle opened fire on a vehicle carrying two Chinese nationals in an industrial area of Karachi in which one of them was critically wounded.In the same month, nearly a dozen Chinese engineers were killed when a bus carrying construction workers was ""attacked"" near a dam project in northwest Pakistan's mountainous region.In November 2018, Baloch separatist militants had attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi but failed to break through the security barrier with three of them killed on the spot.Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on a host of projects being carried out under the aegis of the CPEC."

鈥淓ducation breeds confidence. Confidence breeds hope. Hope breeds peace鈥?鈥?Confucius"
"By Ashanthi Warunasuriya

The first Confucius institute (CI) was opened in 2004 in South Korea, and according to official data there were 548 Confucius institutes around the world by the end of last year, as well as 1,193 Confucius classrooms based in primary and secondary schools.

The number of CIs worldwide reached more than 858 by May 2012, including 358 Confucius institutes and 500 Confucius Classrooms. In addition to those in United States, there are, for example, 83 CIs located in 30 Asian countries, 122 CIs in European countries and 25 CIs in Africa. The CIs operate within established universities, colleges, and secondary schools around the world, providing funding, teachers and educational materials. By borrowing the name Confucius, the CI created a brand that was instantly recognized as a symbol of Chinese culture, radically different from the image of the Communist Party.

The stated aim of the program is to promote Chinese language and culture, support local Chinese teaching internationally, and facilitate cultural exchanges. Some people even mistakenly regard CIs as religious institutions or a unit devoted to the study of Confucianism. Open to the general public, Confucius institutes promote Chinese language but also run classes in culture, from calligraphy and cooking to tai chi. They sponsor educational exchanges and hold public events and lectures. Backed by significant government funding, China aims to have 1,000 such institutes by 2020 in what it calls a 鈥淐onfucius revolution鈥?to tap into the growing overseas demand to learn Chinese.

Since the Communist Party of China doesn鈥檛 have a free press or rule of law to check its use of power, it is no surprise that there have been strong indications that CIs are used for inappropriate covert activities like intelligence gathering, and facilitating military research. Human Rights Watch said in its 2019 report on China: 鈥淐onfucius Institutes are extensions of the Chinese government that censor certain topics and perspectives in course materials on political grounds, and use hiring practices that take political loyalty into consideration.鈥?
Officials from China have compared Confucius institutes to language and culture promotion organizations such as Portugal鈥檚 Instituto Cam玫es, Britain鈥檚 British Council, France鈥檚 Alliance Fran莽aise, and Germany鈥檚 Goethe-Institut鈥攕everal of them named for an iconic cultural figure identified with that country, as Confucius is identified with China. Some commentators argue, unlike these organizations, many Confucius institutes operate directly on university campuses, thus giving rise to what they see as unique concerns related to academic freedom and political influence.

Confucius institutes are used as a form of 鈥渟oft power鈥?by China, (In politics and particularly in international politics, soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce) and the Chinese government spends approximately $10 billion a year on CIs and related programs to exercise these initiatives. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping in 2013 stated that the intentions are to 鈥済ive a good Chinese narrative鈥? Being affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Education, CIs have received increasing skepticism over its censorship of content taught, such as topics related to individual freedoms and democracy, Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang.

Criticism

Confucius institutes have been critiqued for repeatedly straying from their publicly declared key task of providing Mandarin Chinese language training and for venturing into deep ideological territory. There is mounting evidence that the institutes鈥?learning materials distort contemporary Chinese history and omit party-induced humanitarian catastrophes such as the Great Leap Forward (1958-1961) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) entirely.

There have been a number of reports pointing to controversial incidents in the past, including a former senior Chinese Communist Party official, Li Changchun鈥檚 comment that Confucius institutes are 鈥渁n important part of China鈥檚 overseas propaganda set-up鈥? Beijing gradually has taken into consideration the quality of each potential institute to better serve the strategic interests involved in China鈥檚 鈥淕oing Global Cultural Diplomacy鈥?and the statement of 鈥淧opularize Chinese Culture around the World鈥?

As contended by noted China expert Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute (PRI), CIs could be 鈥淭rojan horses鈥?that may 鈥渋ndoctrinate young Americans into thinking that the Chinese Party-State will not be a threat to its own people or to the world at large鈥?

The Case of USA

CIs are working with specific institutes for advanced China studies mostly in the United States and in Europe. It is entirely possible that this offers a way to reinforce a favorable impression of China among local epistemic communities. Although the promotion of Chinese language learning throughout the world is seen as part of China鈥檚 effort to accomplish its foreign policy goals through the use of soft power, CIs have been criticized as propagating an idealized version of Chinese history and culture and stifling academic freedom. Recently, academics predicted a crackdown on CIs across the West.

Especially in the US, where nearly 40 percent of CIs are located, members of the US Congress, the director of the FBI and academic advisory groups have gone so far as to accuse the Confucius institute of being a 鈥渟ubversive鈥?mechanism for increasing China鈥檚 public influence abroad. The Chinese language services provided by the CIs have attracted many universities overseas to establish a CI to meet the high level of demand to learn Mandarin Chinese, with Chinese authorities paying not only for the institutes鈥?operational costs and selected textbooks, but also providing trained Chinese language teachers, the universities can benefit from the financial support to offer Chinese program for students almost for free.

However, criticism occurs about China footing the bill and directly managing the teachers. Critics say CIs are ready-made platforms for the state鈥檚 agenda, promoting an overly rosy image of PRC while discouraging discussion of politics. The anti-CI position occurred in recent times as a consequence of changing ideologies in the West regarding China becoming a main global player, thereby confirming the statement that 鈥渋deologies about language in general have real effects on language policies and practices, and delimit to a large extent what is and is not possible in the realm of language planning and policy making.鈥?
Closing Syndrome

The West also criticizes China鈥檚 unique political system and issues like human rights, etc. Therefore, Western universities intend to govern or limit CIs. This is leading to an anti-CI position regarding CIs as instruments of the Chinese government. Deteriorating relations between Sweden and China have prompted the closing of Confucius institutes and classrooms ending of partnerships. The moves have been prompted by growing concern in Sweden over security, human rights and the jailing in China of a Chinese-born publisher with Swedish citizenship. The Times in London wrote on 21 April that Sweden was believed to be the first country in Europe to close all Confucius institutes and classrooms.

Relations between the two countries have become increasingly restless over several years. There are various issues emanating from Swedish alarm over Chinese takeovers of local companies; security concerns; human rights abuses and repression in China. One of Belgium鈥檚 leading universities has decided to close the Chinese state-funded Confucius institute on its campus, following accusations that the former head professor conducted espionage for China.

There have also been calls in nearby South Korea for greater scrutiny of Confucius institutes. This month a small group, Citizens for Unveiling Confucius institutes, protested outside the Chinese Embassy in Seoul against the existence of CIs in South Korea. Japan has become the latest country to say it will investigate the operations of Chinese Confucius institutes on university campuses in the country."

"The event seemed scripted. Clad in a skin-coloured dress and clutching two bouquets of flowers, she walked out of the hospital. Its staff were at her heels, and so was the Minister of Health Pavithra Wanniarachchi.

At one point Wanniarachchi held the woman鈥檚 head in her hands and placed a kiss on her forehead, a gesture that let lose a media frenzy, given the context of the event. It all looked perfect but for the mask she wore which brought everyone back to stark reality.

Health officials on Wednesday, February 19, were bidding goodbye to Sri Lanka鈥檚 COVID-19 patient, actually the only confirmed case thus far.

The Chinese national, a 47-year-old tourist who visited the country fell ill in late January and was admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) where she was isolated and treated.

On Wednesday, as she left the hospital after recovery. Wanniarachchi expressed her happiness as the health minister to see the tourist returning to China in good health.

As of Friday, novel Coronavirus dubbed COVID-19, has infected 76,775 and killed 2,248. Most of the confirmed cases are reported from the epicenter - Hubei Province. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared China was at a very high risk and elsewhere at high risk. Earlier WHO declared the outbreak an international public health emergency

Sri Lanka was among the 26 countries that had confirmed cases of COVID-19. Several suspected cases have been isolated and are being monitored at designated hospitals across the island.

As the deadly virus started to spread, so did xenophobia and racism. Sri Lanka was not immune to this, which makes the Health Minister鈥檚 picture-perfect kiss a sign of inclusivity.

鈥淏efore, when we walked into a supermarket locals were very friendly and helpful, but after the outbreak we saw a stark difference in the way they treated us,鈥?a Chinese national working in Sri Lanka said. She claimed misinformation was a major trigger for such treatment.

Since the outbreak of the deadly virus, Chinese nationals or those remotely resembling a Chinese faced racism or scapegoating across the globe. Their fate was not dissimilar in Sri Lanka.

Some super markets sported boards stating 鈥楴o Chinese allowed鈥? A person working with Chinese nationals said the management of the building where her office was housed has advised Chinese nationals to use a separate elevator and locald to use another.

A Chinese national said taxis refused to take them, and another said they were refused access to supermarkets. All these sources spoke under condition of anonymity. The Chinese nationals said they understand the fear the locals have towards the mystery virus. 鈥淲e will have to tolerate this xenophobia till the situation improves,鈥?one Chinese national said.

In a statement, Chinese Ambassador Cheng said it was worrisome that some taxis, hotels and restaurants were refusing to entertain Chinese citizens in Sri Lanka.

Resonating the claim made by a Chinese national, Director of Confucius institute at the University of Colombo, a key institute that promotes Chinese language and culture in Sri Lanka, Dr. Wimal Hewamanage also said interpretation of information has led to fear of Chinese.

Referring to several images and videos depicting Chinese nationals consuming bat meat soup, Dr. Hewamanage said, 鈥淲e all eat meat. One may prefer chicken and not even touch pork. This is all depends on how familiar one is with the dish. Then how can we find fault in what another person eat?鈥?
The misinformation has affected all sectors that rely on Chinese trade. Chinese speaking local tour guide Kushan Kanchuka from Homagama said some restaurants refused to cater to his Chinese clients.

Restaurant manager of Grand Beijing, Jaya A. Godage said business at his restaurant has dropped by about 80 per cent. Mostly because the Chinese, who make up the majority of his clients, are not traveling due to the outbreak and also because locals have stopped eating at Chinese restaurants in fear of contracting the virus.

According to the former Director General of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Upali Ratnayake said not only Chinese nationals but those from countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand are subjected to ill treatment as a result of the new outbreak.

鈥淎sia Pacific is the fastest growing economy of the world. This outbreak will affect overall economies of this region,鈥?he added.

China is the second largest economy in the World, and one of the biggest trading partners of Sri Lanka. Secretary General of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, Bandula Dissanayake said the outbreak of Covid19 would have a considerable impact on the Sri Lankan economy.

Chinese tourists comprise the second largest tourist market in the country. According to statistics of the SLTDA China was second to India with 22,363 or 10 per cent of the total arrivals in January this year. In January last year, 26,414 Chinese tourists visited Sri Lanka.

Approximately 37 per cent of the tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka last year were from China, if this situation continues Dissanayake predicts that the Sri Lankan tourism sector would experience difficulties in the near future.

鈥淭here are many infrastructure development projects that Chinese nationals are engaged in Sri Lanka,鈥?he said, adding 鈥淢any of these people returned to their homeland for New Year celebrations and are yet to return to Sri Lanka. There could be delays in these people returning which will affect deliveries of such projects. Production and manufacturing processes in China would be disrupted under this situation and it may affect the trading business in Sri Lanka, as well as supply chain value added businesses at large,鈥?he said.

Dissanayake stressed that it is vital for the Sri Lankan business community to commence discussions on identifying business issues that they face in each sector and arrive at possible solutions.

Sri Lanka is among the countries that has not slapped sanctions against Chinese travellers. The Quarantine Unit at the Ministry of Health is taking necessary precautions to ensure Chinese visitors are not infected with COVID-19 before they enter the country. The Health Ministry has also set up a unit to fight misinformation that is circulating on social media platforms.

Stating that these steps are vital to maintain good relationships between China and Sri Lanka, Chairman of the Committee for Silk Road Research and Tourism Development Affairs under the Association of Sri Lanka-China Social and Cultural Corporation, Prof. Suranga Silva said, COVID-19 effects socio-economic development of the island that depends highly on Chinese assistance.

鈥淚 request all Sri Lankans to be there for the Chinese people without isolating them,鈥?he said, adding China stood by Sri Lanka during vital times.

The Sri Lanka-China Buddhist Friendship Association (SLCBFA) conducted a pirith ceremony to invoke blessing on China to overcome the outbreak."
"Programs on Gwadar Port, Hambantota Port, China-Laos鈥檚 railway, and Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway have achieved great progress to promote connectivity

By Prof. Zhou Guping and Dr. Ni Hao



Since China proposed to build the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, now referred to as the Belt & Road Initiative, considerable attention has been attracted from the international community.



As introduced by the head of NDRC (National Development and Reform Commission) at the Press Conference for the Second Session of the 13th National People Congress (6 March 2018), China has signed 171 cooperation agreements with 123 countries and 29 international organisations, including both developing and developed countries, as well as a great number of companies and financial institutions from developed countries to explore the third-party market jointly.



Regarding the infrastructure, programs on Gwadar Port, Hambantota Port, China-Laos鈥檚 railway, and Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway have achieved great progress to promote connectivity. Zamir Assadi, a reporter from Pakistan, describes it as an unprecedented chance to the global economic communities offered by China. It needs to be further pointed out that the Belt & Road Initiative is not only about money and railways, as represented explicitly in the mass media. Instead, five correlated pillars, namely, policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds are together regarded as the cornerstone of BRI. Among those, people-to-people bonds, which refers to the people-to-people exchanges on culture, education, sports, tourism, heath, laws, youth issues and other people鈥檚 livelihood related fields, is the one easiest to be neglected, whereas hardest to be achieved.



People-to-people bonds accounts for a large enough proportion in China鈥檚 policy priorities. As President Xi Jinping quoted many times, 鈥淥nly when the hearts meet can they achieve enduring friendship鈥? 鈥淎mity between people holds the key to sound relations between states鈥?



Harmony is built on the basis of mutual understanding and cooperation between people. Promoting people-to-people bonds lays a solid foundation for economic and social cooperation, accumulates potential energy for building a community with shared future for mankind. The fascination of exchange reflects in the communication among diverse civilisation with different culture, custom and national conditions. Beyond doubt, Belt & Road Initiative possess not only the attributes of materiality, but spirituality, in nature to enhance mutual learning among civilisations with an open, mutual-respect and future-oriented mind.



Specially, China鈥檚 effort in heath cooperation with countries alongside the Belt & Road make tremendous achievements. Infectious disease control and cure, medical and health system reform, capacity building and talents cultivation are the main domains for heath cooperation.



According to the varying regional demands, China carries out long-term cooperation plans, such as The Prague Declaration signed with central and eastern European countries, the project on building China-Laos Medical Service Community, and public health personnel joint training with Indonesia. Besides, five central Asian countries, Russia, Mongolia and China establish a medical service centre with joint efforts to provide high-quality care. Those projects brought tangible benefits to the common people, in most cases, are lack of health insurance schemes or quality healthcare.



Education matters anywhere, and concerns the future of this generation and our globe. Along the Belt & Road, in many developing countries, there is a great demand in Technical and Vocational Education (TVET). Receiving a certain level of vocational education is an important way for local people to improve their employability and obtain higher income.



Thus, in 2016, Ningbo Polytechnic set up an international training centre in Benin, an under-developed country located in West Africa, to train local employees for the development of Chinese-funded enterprises and promote the economic development of the host country. Also known as China- African (Benin) College of Vocational and Technical Education afterwards, it created a pioneering cooperation model in running schools and also had deep and broad implications for local human capital ecosystem.



Just in two years, the college equipped more than 400 students from Benin and surrounding countries with skills. As the dean of the college recalls, usually the last-year students get job offers from the local industrial park even before graduation, definitely they are 鈥渟weet pastry鈥?in the labour market.



Nowadays, people are surprised to find that Confucius institute is not the only paradigm of Chinese oversea education service, TVET is also gaining momentum to promote skill and talents exchange.



In the past five years, the outcome of Belt & Road Initiative has been fruitful, and more satisfactorily, policymakers are conscious of the significance of strengthening people鈥檚 sense of having gained. The generous B&R scholarship is provided at central government, local authorities and university levels, covering most of the expense in China and attract hundreds of thousands of applications each year. As the old Chinese saying goes, 鈥淭en years to grow trees, but a hundred to cultivate people.鈥?


Engineering and trade is easy, but sincere communication and true empathy is not. The implementation of the Belt & Road Initiative also needs time and true feelings. We here humbly appeal to build a spiritual silk road in the coming decades.

As China came out of its shell to be an economic power with global ambitions following the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by President Xi Jinping, there was a crying need to make people across the world aware of China, the Chinese language and Chinese culture. The isolationist policies of the Maoist era had made China a strange place and its people seem inscrutable.



It was to 鈥渙pen up鈥?China to the world鈥檚 eyes, to inform the world about the cultural underpinnings of the BRI, and to give the BRI a universal appeal, that President Xi chose to project China as a country based on the thoughts of Confucius (551 to 479 BC).



Confucius鈥?social philosophy was based primarily on the principle of 鈥淩en鈥?or 鈥渓oving others鈥?while exercising self-discipline. Confucius believed that 鈥淩en鈥?could be put into action using the golden rule: 鈥淲hat you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.鈥?


According to Ven. Dhammajothi Thero, Director of the Confucius institute at Colombo University, Confucius wanted to make people 鈥済entlemen鈥?and not 鈥渟ages.鈥?This was because it was practicable to be a gentleman and not practical to aim to be sage. Therefore, Confucianism is a practical and implementable philosophy which can be accepted across cultures, an ideal basis for making China and its BRI acceptable across the world.





Twelve years ago, the Xi Jinping regime set up Confucius institutes (CIs) and Confucius Centres (CCs) across the globe primarily to teach the Chinese language, the philosophy of Confucius, and many aspects of Chinese culture. According to Yu Yunfeng, Deputy Chief Executive of the Confucius institute Headquarters and Deputy Director General of Hanban, there are now 525 CIs and 1,113 CCs in 146 countries. And the numbers are growing as the BRI expands its reach constantly.



As Pang Chunxue, Charge de鈥?Affaires at the Chinese Embassy said, most of the CIs are in countries in which are on the BRI route. Justifying this, she said: 鈥淭he CIs鈥?goal of bringing people together matches the goals of the BRI which are to narrow gaps in development between countries.鈥?


CIs and CCs have been growing in numbers in Africa with China鈥檚 increasing economic presence in the continent. In South Asia, they have acquired a firm foothold in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal and have two in Sri Lanka 鈥?at the Colombo and Kelaniya Universities. They have only a marginal presence in India because of New Delhi鈥檚 entrenched suspicions about Chinese initiatives.





The CIs and CCs are funded by the Chinese Government, which also sends teachers. Each CI or CC is attached to a Chinese University and each CI has two Directors, one from China and the other from the host country.



The courses in the CIs and CCs are primarily designed at the Confucius institute Headquarters in China called 鈥淗anban鈥? But in response to demands from the host countries, the courses have been expanded beyond language and culture to include subjects of local interest.



For example, in Pakistan, the CIs at the Agriculture University in Faisalabad, has tied up with an engineering and an agricultural university in Lahore to teach Chinese useful to agriculture and engineering students.



In Nepal, locals are taught vehicle maintenance not only to learn the trade but to be able to work in Chinese infrastructure projects in that rugged country said Prof. Wang Shengli of the CI in Kathmandu University.

Controversies

But the CIs and CCs have become controversial in some countries. They are suspected to be insidious institutions primarily meant to brainwash people of the host countries to wean them away from their entrenched beliefs, and make them think and act like the Chinese, in much the way as Thomas Babington Macaulay wanted to 鈥淎nglicise鈥?Indians in mid-19th Century to make them the backbone of British rule in India.



In the context of present-day China with the BRI being used by Beijing to expand its economic, political and strategic hold on Asia and Africa, there is a fear that the CIs and CCs could be trying to do what Macaulay wanted to do in India. The fear is entrenched in some ex-colonies which are zealous about guarding their sovereignty and national identity. They do not see the CIs as equivalents of the British Council or the American Center which are seen as being 鈥渂enign鈥?



This is because of China鈥檚 sudden rise and its rush to dominate the globe with its economic muscle. The mushrooming of CIs in the last decade is seen as part being part of a hurriedly-pursued expansionist project.



Speaking at the 2018 Joint Conference of Partial Confucius institutes in Asia held in Colombo on 27 and 28 June, Ven. Dhammajothi Thero Director of the CI in Colombo University said: 鈥淭he CI headquarters should make their objectives clear so that there is no misunderstanding and suspicions which are voiced in many countries, as in Vietnam. For this, there should be greater localisation of teaching material and teaching personnel. There should also be a two-way flow with the course content being 50% Chinese and 50% local.鈥?


The monk, who is a fluent Mandarin speaker, said that he opposes all kinds of globalisation, whether Western or Chinese, if that would mean the obliteration of indigenous cultures and thought.





India has allowed CIs but they are not encouraged by the Government, even though there is a growing demand for learning the Chinese language from people trading with China, said Shikha Pandey, Asst. Professor of Chinese Studies in Mumbai University. 鈥淭he Sino-India standoff is standing in the way of the development of China-studies in India,鈥?Pandey said.



But most Asian delegates, who came from countries with BRI projects in them, saw the CIs and CCs as being useful as job providers in BRI projects. As Ven. Dhammajothi said: 鈥淧eople learn a language to get jobs and people in Sri Lanka need jobs.鈥?


Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake, Vice Chancellor of Colombo University noted that it is useful to learn Chinese given the growing presence of Chinese in Sri Lanka, thanks to the massive infrastructure projects. With a Free Trade Agreement on the cards, Chinese and Lankan businessmen would need to communicate with each other and with Chinese tourists pouring in, there would be a need for Chinese knowing interpreters and guides, he said.



Yu Yunfeng, Deputy Chief Executive of the Confucius institute Headquarters and Deputy Director General of Hanban, said that CI top brass are not against improvisation and localisation.



鈥淲e are open and broadminded. The CIs are integrating with local communities and are attempting to use local teachers and local teaching material,鈥?Yu said.



Another official from the CI headquarters, Zheng Menglin, said that the 鈥淐Is belong to all. They help others to understand China and the Chinese to understand other countries and cultures. Towards those ends changes are being made.鈥?




Asking people to be patient, Zheng said: 鈥淭he CI is only 12 years old and is therefore a teenager experiencing growing up pains.鈥?


Backing up Yu Yunfeng and Zheng Menglin, Prof. Ashfaq Ahmad Chattha of the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has created enormous job opportunities for Pakistani youth, thanks to a bilateral agreement between China and Pakistan which enjoins Chinese companies to employ qualified locals.



But another Pakistani delegate from Karachi said that Pakistan had to 鈥渇ight hard鈥?to get the Chinese companies in CPEC to employ local skilled workers because the companies preferred Chinese workers. G. Jimpei, from the CI in Karachi revealed that Chinese companies are not interested in interacting with the CIs. Another Chinese delegate said that while CI might agree to making changes, it might take some time for the rigid Chinese bureaucracy to begin to think differently and creatively.



But there is flip side to job oriented courses in the CIs and CCs. As Kumar Priyanka Jayasooriya, Professor of Chinese at Kelaniya University, said, students who pass out do not come back to teach, even as volunteers, because they get well-paid jobs in the Chinese companies in the island.



鈥淭he reason is that university teachers are poorly paid. Because of a lack of qualified teachers we have to make do with teachers without a post-graduate degree. We also have to depend on part time volunteer teachers. One way to get round the problem is to make it mandatory for those who go to China on scholarships to come back and teach,鈥?Dr. Jayasooriya said."
"YAHAPALANA AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA 鈥?Part 1

KAMALIKA PIERIS

China sees Sri Lanka as a country with much potential. You have 65,000 kilometers of land. You always say a small island country. No, Sri Lanka is a big country. It is a great country. You have good culture, you have long history, you have a legal system, education is okay. You should be proud of the culture, history and your country conditions. So why do you call yourself a tiny island, asked the Chinese Ambassador in 2016.

Sri Lanka is No 1 in the region said the Chinese ambassador at the 2017 University of Colombo, Sujata Jayawardene Memorial talk. The China-Sri Lanka relationship is a bilateral one, not unilateral, he continued. It is joint support. It is a people-to-people exchange, not simply government to government. Chinese tourists are increasing. His emphasis throughout the talk was on friendship with Sri Lanka. He said this over and over again. There will be no occupation of Sri Lanka.

China is Sri Lanka鈥檚 No 1 financial support, also the longest aid giver, continued the ambassador. Last year our grants, donation and commercial and concessionary loans to Sri Lanka amount to RMB 10 billion. China has also given an outright loan of USD 77.2 million. China is Sri Lanka鈥檚 second largest trading partner and Sri Lanka鈥檚 second most significant source of import, as well. Sri Lanka exports to China have been growing at a faster rate than with the rest of the world.

Sri Lanka was China鈥檚 second most preferred place for investments. The South Terminal of the Colombo harbor was constructed and operated by China Merchant Holdings on a 35-year BOT deal. The terminal commenced operations on August 2013, almost 15 months ahead of schedule. This terminal is the first deep-sea port in Sri Lanka capable of handling mega container ships. The China Aero Technology international engineering Corporation CATIC-ENG) complete the Katunayake runway overlay project 18 days ahead of schedule, CATIC used it own funds of USD 35 million.

China is culturally active in Sri Lanka. A Chinese Buddhist roofing ceremony, carried out by a Shaolin Buddhist delegation took place in August 2009 to mark the completion of Phase 1 of Norochcholai coal power plant. A Buddha statue in Shaolin tradition was to be installed there. There were also plans in 2009 for a high level Chinese Buddhist delegation of 102 members to visit Sri Lanka to enhance the bilateral Buddhist cultural relations of over 1000 years between China and Sri Lanka.

Chinese language is now taught in Sri Lanka, with help from the Confucius institute, China. China鈥檚 largest private retailer, Kumming Xinzhi group opened it fifth overseas Chinese bookstore in 2013 in Colombo. It sells books which teach the Chinese language. In 2015, Ladies College, Colombo, announced that they would be teaching Mandarin Chinese at its Department of Vocational Studies. For 鈥榩ublic relations鈥?China had a calligraphy painting session for children at the J.D.A. Gallery, Colombo. It held a joint art exhibition with Sri Lanka participants at BMICH in 2016, under the title 鈥極ne belt One Road (OBOR) exhibition鈥?

Pathfinder Foundation has signed MOUs with 鈥楥hina Institute of Contemporary international Relations鈥?(CICIR) 鈥楥hinese Peoples Association for peace and Disarmament鈥? Hainan based 鈥楤oao Forum for Asia鈥?and China鈥檚 Fujian province Commerce department. Pathfinder Foundation has also set up the 鈥楥hina-Sri Lanka cooperation studies centre鈥?(CSLCSC) in 2015. It will link with the 鈥楽hanghai Institute for International Studies.鈥?After the inauguration of this centre, the Chinese ambassador had a discussion, which lasted for over an hour, with a group of erudite Buddhist monks. He said he would help them learn Chinese and study in China.

Relations between Mahinda Rajapakse and China were always excellent. During his period of government China-Sri Lanka relations went from 鈥榚verlasting friendship鈥?to 鈥榮trategic cooperation鈥? In 2011, President Mahinda went to China to celebrate the 70 anniversary of China鈥檚 University of Foreign studies and the University鈥檚 Sinhala language studies Unit鈥檚 50th anniversary. 14 Chinese students were studying for their first degree in Sinhala language while three others were studying for the MA in Sinhala.

In 2013, Rajapaksa paid a four-day state visit to China at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two sides agreed to upgrade their relations to a strategic cooperative partnership, and vowed to promote cooperation in such areas as trade, investment, tourism and defense. In 2014, Xi met Rajapakse in Shanghai during the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. During their meeting, Xi called for joint efforts to build the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and promote the China-Sri Lanka free trade talks. The Sri Lankan president vowed to facilitate maritime cooperation with China and invited Xi to visit his country.

Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga said that the Chinese authorities gave President Mahinda Rajapaksa Rs.15 billion. The Chinese embassy when contacted, said that they had not met Ms Kumaratunga for more than a year. The story was a malicious falsehood .The embassy had communicated this to Rajapaksa鈥檚 Secretary.

China had built the Hambantota port, Mattala airport and had started on the Colombo Port City when the Yahapalana government took office in 2015. The Yahapalana government started off by criticizing China. They wanted to show that they were now under the protection of America. Yahapalana made its anti-China policy a main plank of its 2015 presidential election campaign. It undertook to drum China out as a development partner immediately after capturing power. it also made a solemn pledge to stop the showpiece Chinese project, the Colombo Port City. Yahapalana was going to put a stop to the Port City. They were not going to allow China to own any part of it.

Then Yahapalana government got into financial difficulties. No one was prepared to give them money, especially when International rating firms like Fitch reduced the nation鈥檚 credit rating. America has no money to give either. So Yahapalana government had to turn to China. They had to physically go to China. China was not coming to Yahapalana. President Sirisena went to China once and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe went twice to negotiate.

Yahapalana wanted China to restructure its USD 8 billion debt, waive certain loans and also give fresh loans. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe tried to get China to swap part of the USD 8 billion it owes to China into equity in infrastructure projects and offered to sell stakes in Sri Lanka companies. However Sri Lanka was not allowed to renegotiate the matter. China pointed out that China had incurred a loss of USD 140 million due to Port City project being suspended for about one and a half years. There was also a USD 125 million penalty demanded by the Chinese contractor for the delay. But Sri Lanka was a 鈥榙ear friend鈥?so China won鈥檛 ask for compensation. No port city, no nothing said China. So Ranil returned home to announce that the Port City in Colombo was on again.

The Chinese ambassador later said at a China-Sri Lanka business meeting in Colombo that incidents such as the suspension of the Port City project should not happen again. Projects must be implemented on the legal contracts entered into. Island editorial said that Yahapalana administration is likely to experience some more turns of the Chinese screw in time to come.

China also made it clear that Yahapalana cannot insult China. The Chinese ambassador called a media conference at the embassy on 1.Nov 2016 to complain that the Minister of Finance, Ravi Karunanayake was asking for more loans after publicly criticizing Chinese funding as 鈥榚xpensive鈥? He said that China gave loans at 2% interest while Europe gave interest at 5.8%. Chinese diplomats never speak out of turn and when they say something it is what the Chinese government wants them to say. Therefore observers wondered whether China sees a regime change ahead.

The National University Teachers Association (NUTA) of Sri Lanka congratulated the ambassador for saying all this. They said that the rapid economic development of Sri Lanka after the war was due to China鈥檚 help. China and Pakistan had consistently stood up for Sri Lanka in UN forums, while USA, UK, India and most European countries advocated a separate state and supported the anti- Sri Lanka diaspora at international forums.

China considers Sri Lanka strategically important and is prepared to work with the present Sri Lanka government. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Li visited Sri Lanka in July 2016. Yu Zhengsheng, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People鈥檚 Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), visited in April 2017. His tour also included Pakistan. The President of China would visit Sri Lanka later in 2017. A branch of China Development Bank will open in Colombo and the yuan will have the same status as US dollar.

In 2016, Sri Lanka entered into a MoU with the Government of China over an agreement on comprehensive implementation of investment, economic and technological cooperation鈥? This would be followed by an MOU with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China, which exercises broad administrative and planning control over the Chinese economy.

New agreements were signed in April 2016. These agreements are not known to the public, but 鈥榓ll Chinese funded projects are back on track鈥? There was a separate agreement for the Port City. Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Beijing Chamber of international Commerce signed an MOU to work together to promote trade and commerce between the two countries. University of Ruhuna has signed two agreements with 鈥楥hinese Academy of Sciences鈥?for a joint masters degree programme in sciences and a China-Sri Lanka joint research progamme (2016) China has donated Rs 2 million to the National Library of Sri Lanka for digitisation.

China is to finance a total of 28 projects amounting to USD 7.6 billion in Sri Lanka. The projects are spread among power, energy, roads, transport, telecommunication, airport and aviation, port, irrigation and water. They include Moragahakanda project, Puttalam coal power, and greater Kurunegala water supply project. An Aircraft overhaul wing was set up at Katunayake. Chinese specialists will run the project until SLAF acquire capability to operate the facility on its own. China is funding a 9 story outpatient department (OPD) wing for the National Hospital, Colombo. The bottom line is that Sri Lanka cannot do without Chinese investments,鈥?said G.L .Pieris.

Several multimillion dollar development projects in Polonnaruwa district are to be given on a single bid to China without tender procedure. The projects include railway extension from Kurunegala to Habarana, Maduru oya right bank development project, road network extensions and the supply of drinking water. China Harbor Engineering Company will conduct a feasibility study of towns east of Polonnaruwa for the water supply project. China State Construction Engineering Corporation will do a feasibility study on rail track and railway stations from Maho to Batticaloa and Gal Oya to Trincomalee. Both free of charge. (continued)"

"Challenges for Ecumenical Responses





| by Mathews George Chunakara*





1. Introduction





( May 23, 2014, Geneva, Sri Lanka Guardian) When the terminology 鈥済eopolitics鈥?was coined at the dawn of the 19th century by the Swedish political scientist Rudolph Kjell茅n, it epitomised an organic conception of great power rivalry and expansion-related political power to geographical space. At the same time, early Anglo-American geopolitical debates concerned the relative importance of land power and sea power, and German discourse was centred on interstate rivalry in continental space. Today, the term geopolitics reflects much wider dimensions, especially the connection between various issues such as politics, nation states, international relations, power and influence, strategic decision-making, geographic space, interplay of natural resources, strategic dominance, various questions related to state and non-state actors, power rivalry, inequality, military, balance of power in given geographical and security contexts, inter-state rivalry and the rise of multi-polarity.





Geopolitics is also centred on the social and political relationships formed among people and their countries. More specifically, when we think in terms of a country or sub-region, geopolitics means the international relationship between or among countries that are located in the same region; of politics, economy, military, culture, religion and so on. Yet geopolitical realities have many other strings attached to the issues normally identified or included within the classical framework of the definition of geopolitics. If we want to meaningfully speak of 鈥榞eopolitics鈥?in South Asia, the term鈥檚 essence and complexity need to be unpacked contextually to go beyond the settings of traditional and conceptual definitions. From this perspective, the emerging trends of geopolitics in South Asia cover a wider spectrum of issues interlinked to much the broader realities of this geographical sub-region as well as to the life of multitudes of South Asians, their struggle for the right to life with dignity and peace with justice.





2. South Asian Realities

South Asia, one of the most heavily populated and diverse regions on the planet, has a common and shared cultural background and experience. These countries are characterised by multi-ethnic societies with striking internal divisions along ethnic, linguistic, regional, communal and sectarian lines. South Asia continues to face crises stemming from a variety of causes 鈥?poverty, civil war, ethnic conflicts, terrorism, communal and political violence, religious intolerance and extremism, power asymmetry within the region, arms build-up and militarisation, gross and systematic violations of human rights, lack of the rule of law and democratic governance in addition to, as well as, geo-political and strategic changes.





World Bank reports claim that South Asia has experienced a long period of robust economic growth, averaging 6 per cent a year over the past 20 years. This strong growth, according to the World Bank, has translated into declining poverty and remarkable advances in human development. The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day fell in South Asia from 61 to 36 per cent between 1981 and 2008. Nonetheless, the region is home to many of the developing world鈥檚 poor and vulnerable. According to the World Bank鈥檚 most recent poverty estimates, about 571 million people in the region survive on less than $1.25 a day, and they make up more than 44 per cent of the developing world鈥檚 poor. The United Nation鈥檚 report on the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2014 predicted that growth in South Asia remains lacklustre as a combination of internal and external factors hamper activity, particularly in the region鈥檚 largest economies, such as India, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan. Growth is estimated to be 3.9 per cent in 2013, nearly the slowest pace in two decades. Growth is forecast to pick up moderately to 4.6 per cent in 2014 and 5.1 per cent in 2015, supported by a gradual recovery in domestic demand in India, an end to the recession in the Islamic Republic of Iran and an upturn in external demand. Slowing growth in South Asia appears to have had a considerable adverse impact on employment. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, South Asia is home to more than one-third of the world鈥檚 people who are 'food insecure'. Economic inequalities and deprivation have created frustration and insecurity among the masses, leading to an increasing criminalisation of society in which there are available targets for exploitation by extremist elements in and outside the governments.





The sub-region remains paradoxical in many ways. It has the world鈥檚 largest working-age population, a quarter of the world鈥檚 middle-class consumers and the largest number of poor and undernourished people in the world. The extent of widespread human deprivation in this region contrasts with the large armies, modern weapons and expanding military budgets. South Asia is the only region where military spending as a portion of GNP has gone up since the end of the Cold War, although it has declined substantially in most other parts of the world.





3. Human Security Perils

Dr Mahbub-ul Haq, who was instrumental in formulating the Human Development Index, advanced the concept of human security in the context of South Asia. Dr Haq, a prominent economist, brought out the 1994 UNDP report on human development which focussed on South Asia. He argued that the imperative of securing people from economic deprivation, hunger, disease, social conflict and environmental degradation should constitute the notion of security within the framework of human rights and human development. This was, in fact, a deviation from the earlier notion of the state-centric paradigm of security or national security. Over the past twenty years, the concept of human security has become dominant.





Today, South Asia鈥檚 human security is threatened and hampered due to various factors. Increasing poverty, inadequate health care, economic exploitation, exploitation of natural resources and environmental degradation; armed conflicts and violence; militarization, arms build-up, nuclearisation, spread of small arms and light weapons; domination and intervention of major powers from outside the region as well as within it; ethnic and religious conflicts, communal violence and political unrest; violations of human rights in various forms: torture, custodial death, human trafficking, violation of the rights of migrant workers, denial of the rights and dignity of stateless people; suppression of people鈥檚 legitimate right to self-determination; lack of rule of law and democratic governance, etc., have become the hallmarks of South Asia today. What we witness in South Asia today is a clear signal of lack of peace and security.





The increasing trend of politics of violence and extremism in South Asia is mainly the result of faulty national policies and the interference of external powers. In most states, governments have failed to provide good governance and solve social problems such as unemployment, social injustice and poverty. Ethnic solidarities, identification with rising religious fundamentalism and ethnocentric cultural aspirations are gaining support, which destroys national unity and integration in almost all South Asian nations. All these trends indicate that the South Asian nations have not been able to provide their people with the basic, minimum human security. Instead of focusing on addressing issues of human survival and development, the rulers of these states embarked upon strategies of perpetuating their power and influence.





Internal security problems in South Asian countries and their ramifications for regional security are influenced by the overwhelming asymmetry in power relations among South Asian countries. Out of fear of their larger neighbours, smaller powers seek external support to preserve and promote their own interests and permit outside powers to exploit the regional differences to their own benefit.





4. Geopolitical and Geostrategic Conundrums

If we agree to the principle that the political significance of geography is related to strategic importance, South Asia has been a strategic location for centuries. The colonialists who invaded this sub-region of Asia always found a strategic point for their arrival and departure while they tried to colonise the South Asian countries or other parts of Asia.





The geopolitical environment of South Asia has been changing drastically over the past twenty-five years. The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, especially the collapse of the global bipolar geopolitical structure, changed the geopolitical contours of South Asia too. The War on Terror again considerably altered the geopolitical landscape of South Asia.





(a) USA in South Asia鈥檚 geopolitical context

The new strategic initiative of the USA, widely known as the 鈥減ivot to Asia鈥? launched in November 2011, has a strong component of involvement of the US in South Asia鈥檚 strategic and security agenda. This new initiative was also considered as a shift of the US. global strategic focus from Afghanistan and Iraq towards the Asia-Pacific region. At the same time, many interpret it as a bid to counteract China鈥檚 influence in the region. The transformed US strategy towards Asia has already raised eyebrows and anxiety in Asia since it might affect peace and security in the region, and South Asia is not exempted from these wider strategic plans. Despite concerns over US strategic goals and plans in Asia, one may argue that the American military has never been more welcome in Asia than it is today. Almost all South Asian countries offer the USA generous access to bases, ports and sovereign sea-lanes and openly support America鈥檚 military and diplomatic presence in the region. Since final approval of the US-India nuclear deal in 2008, which effectively legitimized India as a nuclear power, naval cooperation between the two countries has increased.





India and the USA have been making a series of efforts to intensify their collaboration that started more than two decades ago. Indo-US military collaboration began in January 1992 during the Narasimha Rao government through the creation of an India-US Army Executive Steering Committee, followed by the setting up of the Joint Steering Committee of the two navies and two air forces and conducting joint naval exercises. The Indo-US Military Cooperation Agreement, signed in 1995, was the first of its kind; it provided for officers of the Indian Armed forces to be sent to the US for training programmes, staff exchanges and joint exercises. The BJP-led Vajpayee government later declared that India was a natural ally of the US and advanced the military collaboration to the level of a strategic alliance. The BJP government offered port and airport facilities for the US armed forces when they began their military operations in Afghanistan after the September 11 terrorist attacks. When the US decided to make Pakistan the frontline state and ally against the war on terror, the BJP-led government came forward to propose India as a junior partner for US strategic interests in the region. During the same period, the Indian government allowed the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to set up its office in Delhi. India became the first country which welcomed the National Missile Defence programme announced by President Bush. The BJP-led government also agreed to use Indian naval ships to escort US ships through the straits of Malacca. The framework agreement on India-US Defence Relations signed in Washington on 8 July 2005 was a major step to harness India to serve the US strategic goals in Asia. The agreement talks about shared security interests in protecting free flow of commerce via land, air and sea lanes along with preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and associated materials, data and technology.





The US involvement in South Asia has been unprecedented. The strategy of the US at that time had much to do with the interest of the USA in the Indian Ocean, which is the important 鈥淪ea lane of Communication鈥?(SLOC). As more than 60% of the oil from the Middle East passes through the Indian Ocean, this sea route is of vital importance to the global economy, especially of the USA and Japan. With nuclear tests conducted both in India and Pakistan, there was a major geopolitical upheaval, attracting international attention and intervention in the region. This has given a momentum to the arms race and has further destabilized the region. In addition, the USA鈥檚 interest in the end of the ongoing ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka was not viewed as an act of a real concern or a genuine search for conflict-resolution, but as being mainly due to a special interest in establishing a naval base in Trincomalee, the world鈥檚 third-largest natural harbour.





Nine years after the first US drone strike in Pakistan鈥檚 Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in 2004, the US refuses to officially acknowledge the CIA-run programme, while Pakistan denies consenting to it. This secrecy undermines efforts to assess the programme鈥檚 legality or its full impact on FATA鈥檚 population. It also diverts attention from a candid examination of the roots of militancy in the poorly governed tribal belt bordering southern and eastern Afghanistan and how best to address them. Drone strikes may disrupt FATA-based militant groups鈥?capacity to plan and execute cross-border attacks on NATO troops and to plot attacks against the US homeland, but they cannot solve the fundamental problem. The ability of those groups to regroup, rearm and recruit will remain intact so long as they enjoy safe havens on Pakistani territory and efforts to incorporate FATA into the constitutional mainstream are stifled.





Since 2004, there have been at least 350 drone strikes in FATA, mostly in the North Waziristan, South Waziristan and Kurram agencies. These have killed significant numbers of al-Qaeda leaders and senior militant commanders of both the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban, but also scores of innocent civilians. Pakistan鈥檚 attitude towards drones borders on the schizophrenic. Rather than inherently opposing the strikes, its leadership, in particular its military, seeks greater control over target selection. This is often to punish enemies, but sometimes, allegedly, to protect militants who enjoy good relations with, or support from, the military 鈥?leaders of the Haqqani network, for example, or some Pakistani Taliban groups with whom the military has made peace deals.





The withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan will soon affect the military balance between Pakistan, India and China, and this will have wider geopolitical and geo-strategic ramifications in this sub-region. Pakistan hopes that it can reinsert the Taliban into a position of primacy in Afghanistan and it will push hard in this direction, but it will have to face difficulties. In the late 1980s, Pakistani diplomats and intelligence officials aired the argument that an ultra-conservative Islamist government in Kabul would serve Western interests by blocking Soviet expansion. They also claimed that Pakistan had a right to act as the king-maker in Afghanistan, since it had played a dominant role in forcing the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. Now the dynamics is changed. The US prefers to maintain a stronger regional presence, whether through drones or Special Forces, than it ever did in the 1990s. India, having invested massively in Afghanistan鈥檚 development over the past decade, is not about to accept a return to the 1990s, when it was completely pushed out of the country by Pakistan-backed Islamists. China, which has long been ambivalent about the Taliban, not least due to its own problems with its Muslims majority in the Xinjiang region, will play both ends. China will also play its strategic steps and rely on China鈥檚 friend and ally Pakistan to contain the Taliban from attacking Chinese economic interests in Afghanistan. At the same time, both India and China have a common interest in stabilizing Afghanistan, mainly for their economic advantages. Pakistan is interested in using Afghanistan as a base for training Jihadist groups outside its own territory.





(b) China and South Asia鈥檚 geopolitical factors

China鈥檚 economic strength has been transforming its position in the world in different ways and this is more evident in South Asia too. China鈥檚 sphere of influence is growing in South Asian countries in different ways, by way of extending its development and economic supports, expansion of business interests, strategic and security influences. China has been enlarging its strategic footprints in Indian backyards like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan and the Maldives.





China鈥檚 more assertive territorial claims caused anxiety recently in several of the South East and North East Asian countries as did the provocative strategy applied in the case of its territorial claim with India. During the visit of Chinese leaders last year to Delhi, they spoke of 鈥渟trategic鈥?and 鈥渕aturing鈥?relations of mutual trust and of China's and India's shared regional interests. However, the subsequent incursion and setting up of a camp of Chinese military forces 19 kilometres inside the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC) became a thorny issue. China has been claiming some 90,000 sq. kms of Arunachal Pradesh as its own and this has become a constant source of tension in China-India relations. China has also been claiming Tawang, home of an ancient Buddhist monastery, in Arunachal Pradesh. The annual increase in China鈥檚 military budget is another factor for dissatisfaction among its neighbours and among South Asian countries. China鈥檚 defence budget in 2012 was about US$106.4 billion 鈭?the second-largest in the world. It was increased to US$ 115.7 billion in 2013. China is concerned about India鈥檚 growing economic and military power too, especially its dominance in the Indian Ocean and its growing strategic and security relations with the US and Japan.





The growing involvement of China in Pakistan and Sri Lanka is a most serious concern for India. As part of broader agreements between China and Pakistan, the Gwadar port of Pakistan is now under the direct management of China. Gwadar, at the juncture of Central Asia, the Indian Ocean and the Middle East, is seen as the latest strategic choke point of China in the strategic hub of Asia, adding more advantages to China鈥檚 鈥渆ncirclement鈥?strategy. This advantage helps Beijing with access to raw materials and energy supplies from the Middle East and Africa through a series of choke points across South Asia from mainland China to Port Sudan. However, India鈥檚 increasing naval presence in the Indian Ocean will hinder China鈥檚 ambitions. Chinese companies are involved in a number of infrastructure, communication and port development projects of strategic importance funded by Chinese loans. These include the Hambantota port project Phase-I, completed at a cost of $360 million (85% financed by the Chinese) and Phase II, with construction underway; the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport near Hambantota built at an estimated cost of $210 million, completed in March 2013.





China鈥檚 strategic clout in Sri Lanka has been increasing in recent years and stronger collaboration has developed with an aim of building closer strategic linkages with Sri Lanka. China became the largest development aid donor to Sri Lanka in 2012. During the period between 1971 and 2012, China provided Sri Lanka with a total of U.S $5.05 billion. Out of this, about $4.76 billion or 94 per cent was extended during the period from 2005 to 2012, according to the Sri Lanka Ministry of Finance and Planning鈥檚 External Resources Department鈥檚 2012 report. At the same time, India extended only a total assistance of US $1.45 billion between 2007 and 2012; of this amount, $1.12 billion was loan assistance and 326 million were grants.





China鈥檚 involvement and presence and development fronts are increasingly evident in Sri Lanka as well. China has already entered Sri Lanka鈥檚 real estate field as well as certain manufacturing projects. Chinese language teaching and cultural spread are also in the pipeline, especially through the initiative of opening a Confucius Centre in Colombo. President Rajapaksa鈥檚 strategy now is to favour China as a counterweight to reduce his dependence on India, especially when India鈥檚 Sri Lanka policy is so heavily influenced by the strong anti-Sri Lankan flavour of Tamil Nadu politics. The new political developments in India鈥檚 Sri Lanka policy may well assist rather than hinder China in establishing its influence in Sri Lanka.





China鈥檚 influence in other South Asian countries is not minimal either. For example, India has been the major partner of Bangladesh since 1971, but in recent years, China鈥檚 involvement there has increased manifold. The growing military relations between China and Bangladesh have regional security implications and Dhaka is now heavily depending on Beijing for its defence requirements and development needs. China sees its foothold in Bangladesh as a part of its quest to establish its regional power profile; and as a means to challenge India in its own backyard. Bangladesh armed forces are dependent on China鈥檚 military hardware. The Army is equipped with Chinese tanks, the Navy with Chinese frigates and missile boats and the Air Force with Chinese fighter jets. The defence cooperation agreement signed between two countries in 2002 is still in place and covers military training. China has promised development of the Chittagong port for 鈥榚nhanced鈥?trade with an aim to establish its control there in the same way as it has done over the Gwadar port in Pakistan and Hambantota in Sri Lanka. From a base in Chittagong, it will be easy for China to monitor Indian missile tests at Chandipur-at-sea near Balasore on the Indian east coast and also to monitor India鈥檚 naval activity in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. As China established an intelligence-gathering station on Great Coco Island in Myanmar in 1992 to monitor Indian naval activity in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, free access to Chittagong port will have the additional value of inter-linking its electronic listening systems at Coco Island.





Nepal is the other South Asian country where China is expanding its hold. Last year, Nepal's highest-ranking military officer returned from China with many promises. The trip served to highlight Beijing's growing political, economic and cultural influence in Nepal. Both countries have agreed to widen their defence and security ties and training cooperation between their militaries. While India looks on with consternation, Nepal tries to leverage its crucial geopolitical position between the Asian giants for its own benefit. China is investing a multi-billion-dollar project to develop hydro-power in Nepal. The Chinese government is officially sending Mandarin language teachers to Kathmandu to provide language training to Nepalese; this is being carried out under the auspices of the Confucius institute, which promotes Chinese culture and language.





Bhutan has been the only one of China鈥檚 14 neighbours with which it doesn鈥檛 have diplomatic relations, and it has been looking to win Bhutan over from India鈥檚 orbit. India is landlocked from the west and the north by its hostile neighbours, Pakistan and China. Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka are countries in which India has knowingly or unknowing abandoned its strategic space to China over the years. Due to India鈥檚 strategic blunder of neglecting its smaller neighbours or leaving their concerns unattended, these countries are now more under the influence of China.





5. Conflicts and Violence

Armed conflicts and violence are daily occurrences in several parts of South Asia. The Human Security Report of 2012 reported that in 2009, South Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) alone accounted for two-thirds of the world鈥檚 total battle deaths from state-based armed conflict. The region had four times as many battle deaths as the next-deadliest region, sub-Saharan Africa. Terrorism and counter-terrorism have also been taking the lives of hundreds of people in South Asia every week.





Armed insurgency is widely spread in different South Asian countries. The influx of small arms and narcotics are considered as major reasons for several conflicts and violence. In certain other contexts, the issue of greater autonomy and reorganization of the state or provincial structures are demanded on ethnic lines. The nature of armed conflicts in certain other contexts concern power- sharing incompatibility over territory and governance as well as exploitation of natural resources by private, state-sponsored or multinational companies. When control over natural resources by local and multinational companies is taken by force, the original owners of the land, especially the indigenous communities, are driven out of their ancestral lands.





There are many factors and key stakeholders from within as well as outside the region contributing threats to human security and denial of justice and peace in South Asia. The increasing trend towards a politics of violence and extremism in South Asia is mainly the result of faulty national policies. Ethnic solidarities, identification with rising religious fundamentalism and ethnocentric cultural aspirations are gaining support, which destroys national unity and integration in almost all South Asian nations.





The politics of Bangladesh has been volatile for long time. The country was under military rule for 15 years. Although democracy was restored in 1990, the antagonism between the main political parties 鈭?the Awami League and Bangladesh Nationalist Party 鈭?as well as personal animosity between two women leaders have pushed the country to the brink of political turmoil and violence. When political tensions spilled over into violence, hundreds of people lost their lives. Following the parliamentary elections held in early January this year, Bangladesh continues to face violence and political unrest.





Ethnic and religious conflicts and violence kill people in different parts of Pakistan almost every day. Discrimination of people on the basis of caste and denial of their human dignity continue to cause social deprivation and marginalization in India and Nepal. Gender-based violence has also been an increasing trend in the South Asia region. In 2013, the world witnessed a growing awareness among South Asians on the increase of gender-based violence against women in their societies. This was mainly due to the anger and protests triggered off by incidents such as the shooting of Malala Yousafzai, a young Pakistani girl, and the gang rape of a young woman in Delhi in December 2013. The passage of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013 and the Sexual Harassment of Women in the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 were positive signs that affirm the faith in legal systems. The protests in India were motivated or emulated in civil society in Nepal by the Occupy Baluwatar Movement. Since its inception on December 28, 2012, the movement has been providing a platform for voiceless Nepali women victims of injustice to seek state redress. The youth-led movement took up five cases of violence against women and helped sensitise society and the political leadership around this issue; this is a positive sign of growing awareness and of a people鈥檚 resistance movement.





6. Religion: a dominant geopolitical factor

Religion has re-emerged as a dominant factor in geopolitics and national and international politics. The religious dimensions of the Sri Lankan Civil War still continue to affect post-war reconstruction and reconciliation as ethnicity and religion are intertwined. Religion is returning to the centre-stage in the civil and political life of almost all South Asian nations. Moreover, these countries are facing an unprecedented increase in religious extremism, intolerance and religious conflicts. Over the years, governments in these countries, whether democratically elected or military, have used religion, ethnicity and caste in order to strengthen their base and maintain their power. To a certain extent, this has been one of the main factors that has further strengthened the fundamentalists and extremist forces in their respective societies.





In the midst of growing uncertainty and political stalemate in Bangladesh, the usually moderate and tolerant country has been facing an increasing trend of religious extremism. It is now widely perceived that Bangladesh has fast become a new centre of terrorism under the BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI) government over the years, especially since a move to turn Bangladesh into a Wahabi Islamic country. Madrassa education has been instigating fundamentalism in Bangladesh as it has in Pakistan. Madrassas have now become the breeding grounds of religious extremism; the authorities failed to nip it in the bud and it has now gone out of control. The more alarming trend of religious intolerance, religious extremism and politicisation of religion and religionisation of politics has been evident in India in recent years, especially a trend of Hindutva ideology is gaining momentum in Indian politics.





The politicisation of religion for electoral gains as a religious fundamentalists' strategy is another menace faced by countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh has been experiencing a spate of violence and killings in recent months and politicization of religion has also become the way Bangladesh political parties take the law into their own hands 鈭?a trend now totally out of control . Following the 5 January election, Hindus and their worship places were attacked by the JEI and BNP in Pabna, Faridpur, Lalmonirhat and Khagrachari districts. Attacks against religious minorities is the Wahhabi/Moududi creed of non-tolerance of any other religion. The increased volatility in Bangladesh politics makes it likely that religious extremism will grow in the coming days. The birth of another extremist group, the Hifazat-e-Islam Bangladesh (HIB) is no accident. It is a product of privately funded madrassas supported by radical Islamist groups from outside and inside, especially the JEI. The 13-point demand made by the HIB is almost similar to that of the Taliban. Women and the minorities have no rights.





The growing trend of religious intolerance and religious conflicts hinder peace and communal harmony. The situations of ethnic conflict and sectarian violence in Myanmar's Rakhine and Shan states are examples of racial and religious intolerance plaguing a deeply fractured nation still struggling to emerge from half a century of military rule. Ethnic Muslims have been the victims since the violence began in Myanmar鈥檚 western Rakhine state last year, and this has now spread to eastern Myanmar鈥檚 Shan state. Hundreds of people have died in clashes between majority Buddhists and minority Muslims belonging to the ethnic Rohingyas. The violence that occurred last year drove more than 140,000 people, mostly Muslims, from their homes. This is in addition to a large number of Rohingyas who were forced to leave Myanmar and are now living in Bangladesh as stateless people.





7. Arms build-up

Escalations of militarisation and arms-build up have been on the increase in South Asia in recent years where the increase in defence spending has now become another prevalent phenomenon. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (London), Asia's military spending for the first time in modern history overtook the European members of NATO last year. Domestic political calculations are another factor behind the region鈥檚 defence splurge. The Bangladeshi government increased the country's defence budget by over 11 per cent for the fiscal year ended in June 2012. Pakistan鈥檚 defence budget was hiked up ten per cent for the fiscal year 2012-2013. The Union Budget of India for 2012-13 allowed a hike for defence, which already stands at US$ 40.44 billion. This represents a growth of 17.63 per cent over the previous years 鈥?one of the highest increases in recent years.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militant group claimed responsibility for the blast, which took place near a university campus, adding in an email sent to a Reuters reporter that it had been carried out by a woman suicide bomber.

The blast was the first major attack against Chinese nationals in Pakistan since last year when a suicide bomber blew up a passenger bus in the Upper Kohistan district that killed 13 people, including nine Chinese.

Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi told reporters the blast killed three foreigners and a local.

鈥淭he reports we have got is that they鈥檙e Chinese,鈥?he said in comments telecast live from the scene of the crime. He said the three Chinese were teachers at Karachi University.

The three dead Chinese included the director of the Chinese-built Confucius institute, which offers Chinese language graduate classes, and two teachers. The fourth fatality was the Pakistani driver of the van, the officials said.

鈥淚t is too early to say what kind of a blast it is,鈥?police officer Muqaddas Haider told reporters. 鈥淲e have a confirmation of four deaths, but I can鈥檛 say anything about their identities.鈥?
When asked, Haider declined to confirm television reports that the foreigners were among the occupants of the van.

Abdul, Khaliq, a police official, said an investigation was underway. No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion.

The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a proscribed militant group active in Balochistan, has targeted Chinese nationals in attacks in the past.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later in the day, visited the Chinese Embassy here and conveyed his condolence over the death of Chinese nationals in a blast that took place in Karachi earlier in the afternoon.

PM CONDOLES WITH CHINESE OFFICIALS

The prime minister met Chinese Charge鈥檇 Affaires Pang Chunxue and sympathized with the government and the people of China as well as the bereaved families.

The prime minister, who was accompanied by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, assured a swift probe into the tragedy to take the culprits to task.

鈥淚 want to assure you on my behalf, on behalf of the Government of Pakistan and the people of Pakistan, that we will hunt down the perpetrators, culprits, killers. We will not rest until they are caught and given exemplary punishment,鈥?the prime minister said talking to the Chinese media at the embassy.

He instructed the authorities concerned to provide foolproof security to the Chinese nationals as well as the organizations.

Calling it an attack on China-Pakistan cordial relations, the prime minister resolved that the Government would not let the bilateral ties be undermined through such acts.

He said Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah would visit Karachi on Wednesday to assist the Sindh government in the investigation and extend all required cooperation from the Federal Government to nab the culprits.

Moreover, he said, the government would review the entire security risks to the Chinese people and take all possible measures to strengthen the security of Chinese nationals in Pakistan.

鈥淲e will not allow any disturbance in this friendship, come what may. We will cut their hands and stop them from creating any differences,鈥?he resolved.

The prime minister, in his condolatory remarks at the embassy, wrote, 鈥淲e are deeply shocked and distressed at this dastardly attack. All Pakistanis mourn their loss and offer their condolences to the bereaved families.鈥?
He also reiterated the government鈥檚 commitment to eliminating all militants and terrorists from the Pakistani soil. 鈥淲e won鈥檛 rest until the culprits are hunted down and given exemplary punishment,鈥?he wrote.

CONDOLENCES POUR IN

As the condolences started pouring in, Jamiat Ulem-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief, Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman strongly condemned the suicide attack occurred at Karachi University.

In a message, he offered his condolences to those foreigners and compatriots who were killed in the suicide attack.

Maulana Fazl said he was equally feeling the pain and suffering of the victims and their families at this crucial hour.

He proposed the government to make fool proof arrangements for the safety of foreigners, especially Chinese brothers.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari strongly condemned the terrorist attack on a van at Karachi University, killing three Chinese faculty members and their Pakistani driver.

The PPP chairman, in a statement issued by the Media Cell Bilawal House, expressed deep grief and sorrow over the loss of precious human lives in the attack.

鈥淚 am sure the Sindh Police will ferret out the terrorists and they will soon be in the clutches of law,鈥?he added.

Bilawal Bhutto stressed that fool-proof measures should be taken to ensure security of the Chinese citizens in Pakistan.

He also prayed for early recovery of those injured in the attack.

The Federal Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Security, Shazia Marri also strongly condemned the blast incident which occurred in Karachi terming it as a cowardly act to destroy the peace of Pakistan.

鈥淭he Pakistani nation has bravely fought terrorism and will continue to do so in the future,鈥?Shazia Marri said in a statement.

The federal minister expressed condolences to the victims of the incident and prayed for the safety of the injured.

Pakistan鈥檚 enemies will not succeed in their nefarious designs through such cowardly attacks, she said.

Expressing condolences over the death of Chinese citizens, Shazia Marri said 鈥淧ak-China brotherly relations will not be affected by such terrorist activities鈥?"

"Violence and terrorism are increasingly making their presence felt across the country. Karachi saw a terrifying example of that on Tuesday afternoon, with a van blown up near the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi. Four people, including three persons of foreign origin, were killed and four others injured. The attack seems to have targeted Chinese nationals. The police have confirmed this was a suicide attack, carried out by a female suicide bomber; and the Balochistan Liberation Army鈥檚 Majeed Brigade has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Back in November 2018, there was an attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi, which was also claimed by the BLA. In 2020, the BLA claimed responsibility for the attack on the Karachi stock exchange. Baloch militants were also said to be behind a 2021 attack in Dasu, targeting a bus carrying Chinese nationals 鈥?the attack killed nine Chinese nationals. That too was said to be a suicide attack. Pakistan has already seen the TTP brand of terrorism making a comeback in the country. And now attacks targeting the Chinese are an added security concern. It is also no secret that CPEC has led to resentment in many countries, which see any kind of progress on the corridor as a threat.

The Shehbaz Sharif-led government has a lot on its plate with a struggling economy and now a precarious security situation. We already have a National Action Plan (NAP) that needs to be implemented in letter and spirit. With the country already on the FATF grey list, NAP needs to be revitalized so that there is a combined well-thought-out plan on how to deal with the hydra-like terror situation in the country. Thousands of lives have already been lost in the war against terror. It is important that NAP be reassessed in order to fight the terror threat staring us in the face. Pakistan cannot afford to go back to the 2007-08 time, when terrorism was at its peak. It took many years to reach a place where there is far less insecurity regarding daily terror attacks. But attacks such as the one at Karachi University shatter the fragile peace that has been maintained the past few years.

Such attacks are also an unwelcome and stark reminder of just how much of the battle against violent radicalization and terrorism is still left. The fact that Tuesday鈥檚 suicide attack took place in a university makes it even more disturbing. While terror and violence in any form must be condemned, attacks at places of learning need to be condemned even louder. A university should be a safe space, regardless of what is going on outside its gates. We have unfortunately not seen that, with even schoolchildren not spared in terror attacks over the years. Given that the coalition government in place has spoken of Balochistan鈥檚 issues, perhaps this is the time to open a dialogue with those elements that are open to debate and reason, so that violent groups are starved of the recruits they get from disillusioned, radicalized young men and women."
"BEIJING: China has expressed its strong condemnation of the Karachi terrorist attack and extended deep condolences to the victims and sympathies to the injured and bereaved families.

鈥淭he Chinese side expresses strong condemnation and indignation over this major terrorist attack and extends deep condolences to the victims and sympathies to the injured and bereaved families,鈥?a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.

鈥淥n the afternoon of April 26, a van of the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi was hit by a suicide terrorist attack. So far, the incident has left three Chinese teachers dead and one injured. There are also casualties on the Pakistani side,鈥?he said in a statement issued here.

The spokesperson said that the Chinese Foreign Ministry and diplomatic missions in Pakistan had activated the emergency response mechanism immediately after the incident.

Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Jianghao made an urgent phone call to the Pakistani Ambassador to China, Moin ul Haque to express extremely grave concern.

He demanded that the Pakistani side should immediately make a thorough investigation of the incident, apprehend and punish the perpetrators to the full extent of the law, and take all possible measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in Pakistan and prevent such incidents from happening again.

鈥淭he Chinese Embassy in Pakistan and Consulate-General in Karachi are working with the Pakistani side to deal with the follow-up matters of the casualties,鈥?the spokesperson said.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan on the evening of April 26 to convey condolences, saying that the Pakistani government will conduct an in-depth probe into the incident, give exemplary punishment to the perpetrators, and strengthen the security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan in an all-round way.

He said his government will never allow any force to undermine the Pakistan-China friendship. Local authorities in Sindh and Karachi have launched a full-scale investigation to hunt down the perpetrators.

The spokesperson said that the Chinese Foreign Ministry and Chinese diplomatic missions in Pakistan would continue to urge relevant Pakistani departments to handle properly the follow-up matters of those killed, treat the injured, and resolutely crack down on the terrorist organization involved.

鈥淭he blood of the Chinese people should not be shed in vain, and those behind this incident will surely pay the price,鈥?he added.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Ambassador to China, Moin ul Haque has expressed shock and mourned the loss of precious lives including Chinese nationals in the Karachi terrorist attack.

鈥淭he entire nation is in shock and mourns the loss of these precious lives including our Chinese friends,鈥?he said in a message.

He said that this cowardly act was a direct attack on the Pakistan-China friendship and ongoing cooperation."

He expressed the confidence that the government would spare no efforts to apprehend the perpetrators and hold them accountable.

"ISLAMABAD: PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Wednesday became the youngest foreign minister of Pakistan.

President Arif Alvi administered the oath to Bilawal, who is 33 years, seven months, and six days of age, as federal minister.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif witnessed the ceremony here at Aiwan-i-Sadr, which was attended by former president Asif Ali Zardari, former prime ministers Yousuf Raza Gillani and Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, and a number of MPs, party workers, and government officials.

The family of Bilawal 鈥?including sister Aseefa Bhutto and maternal aunt Sanam Bhutto, the sister of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto 鈥?also attended the ceremony.

The Cabinet Division later issued a notification appointing Bilawal as the foreign minister.

He joined the cabinet in the third phase of its formation as the earlier swearing-in ceremonies were taken place on April 19 and April 22.

Assuming charge as the foreign minister, Bilawal was welcomed at the Foreign Office by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar and Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood. During his visit, Bilawal interacted with senior ministry officials.

Bilawal also paid a visit to the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad. He regretted the lives lost in Tuesday鈥檚 suicide attack outside the University of Karachi鈥檚 (KU) Confucius institute.

鈥淭he relationship between Pakistan and China is a series of loyalties from generation to generation.

鈥淭errorists made a failed attempt to strike the foundation of the Pak-China friendship,鈥?he said.

During Tuesday鈥檚 press conference, Bilawal had explained his decision of joining PM Shehbaz鈥檚 cabinet and said 鈥渙ne-sided decision making鈥?is not possible and it is up to all the political parties to find solutions to the problems collectively.

鈥淲e have to understand that this isn鈥檛 an ordinary coalition government. This unity government is a result of the parties on the opposition benches going to the treasury benches for the first time in the history of Pakistan.

鈥淭his is a very big challenge [and] everyone must play their role and share their burdens,鈥?the PPP chairman had added.

He had expressed the hope that as part of the team, at times the PPP鈥檚 priorities would be given weight and sometimes those of other political parties would take the forefront so solutions could be found together.

The new cabinet reflects the political mix of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), PPP, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P)."

The horrific attack targeting a van carrying Chinese academics near the Confucius institute in Karachi University has sent shockwaves across the country particularly because it reflects a new, more brutal wave of terror attacks. It is a rare instance of an attack on Chinese nationals allegedly carried out by a female suicide bomber. The profile of the alleged culprit鈥攁 mother with two degrees from an educated, well-off family, bellies the traditional image of a militant, and indicates a dangerous new turn in terrorism tactics.

This attack should be a wake-up call on how deep anti-state elements have been rooted that they are able to now brainwash and train ordinary women into becoming suicide bombers. A background check of the history of the alleged culprit indicates that she had been inculcated into the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a terrorist group, specifically the Majeed Brigade group, indicating that these foreign-funded terrorist factors are targeting university students into becoming militants.

The sole purpose of this attack was to weaken Pakistan. The BLA鈥檚 consistent attempts to target Chinese nationals and disrupt progress in the country clearly show that the interests of the province are not what they are fighting for; rather it is evident that a larger game to disrupt the country鈥檚 development and harm relationships is at play. The BLA鈥檚 terrorist activities are different from some legitimate grievances of the Baloch people, grievances which have often been addressed to and listened to by the Pakistani state. This malicious attack, with its roots in non-state funding, only causes damage to the Baloch people, and the use of women as suicide bombers reflects an alarming revelation of how far these non-state actors are willing to go to cause discord in Pakistan. The authorities must take note of the new insidious ways with which these non-state actors are trying to sabotage CPEC and threaten the stability and peace of the country."

鈥楺uds Day鈥?is now observed every year on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramazan-ul-Mubarak in more than 80 countries throughout the world. It was aimed to express unity with Palestine Muslims fighting for their legal rights, he said while speaking to journalists at an interactive meeting and iftar-dinner reception, here at the Iranian Consulate.

He maintained that the founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Muhammad Iqbal were amongst the top leaders of the Islamic world who took similar position on Al-Quds issue 鈥?aggression and occupation by Israel. In 1938, he referred to, Quad-i-Azam described the slain Arabs in the struggle against Israeli occupation as 鈥?martyrs鈥?and he had strongly condemned the then British Imperialism for its support to establishment of an illegal regime in the territory of Palestine.

He said this year also witnessed that the occupying Zionist regime on sacred land of Palestine brutally attacked and injured a significant number of Muslim worshippers and desecrated our first Qibla, the holy shrine of masjid Al-Aqsa.

He said after establishment of Zionist Israeli regime, four million Palestinians were still living in the worst conditions at camps. Over two million Palestinians had been under complete humanitarian siege in Gaza for last 15 years, and it was very painful for the humanity in the last century. Thousands of people were being held, imprisoned, and tortured in the prisons of Israeli settlements and it was feared that with development of more such settlements, more Palestinians including children and women would be killed.

He quoted our last Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that it is a duty of every Muslim to rush for helping other fellow believers when they are in trouble and call for help. Thus, the entire Muslim Umah must respond aggressively to the occupation and brutalities on innocent Palestine Muslims by Israel.

Iranian Consul General condemned the suicide attack on the van carrying Chinese teachers of Confucius institute, at University of Karachi.

She said no channel, programme or newspaper will be closed. She, however, called for practical steps to curb fake news in the country. She said fake news was run about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif鈥檚 visit to Saudi Arabia.

Marriyum Aurangzeb said Shehbaz Sharif as chief minister of Punjab had paid all the expenses of his foreign tours from his own pocket. She said the prime minister will also bear expenses of his upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia.

She maintained that everyone should be guaranteed safety in a university, regardless of what they were coming to learn.

Syeda Farwa, a protestor, claimed that it was now the responsibility of the Pakistani government to ensure that the Chinese government were aware that the terrorists were a different, separate entity.

Professor Nasir Khan, strongly condemning the act, said that the terrorism against the Chinese teachers was not acceptable under any circumstances.

Earlier this week, four people 鈥?three Chinese nationals and a Pakistani man 鈥?were killed in an attack by a female suicide bomber outside the Chinese language centre inside the Karachi University on Tuesday.

Four others, including a Chinese national and Rangers personnel, were also injured in the blast that ripped through a van carrying the university teachers, Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon told the media at the scene of the attack.

Raja Umar Khattab, the head of the Counter-terrorism Department, confirmed that it was a suicide attack carried out by a woman outside the Confucius institute.

With additional reporting by Mashael Shah."
"KARACHI 鈥?The woman suicide bomber, who killed four people in Karachi this week, was a married science teacher, a mom with two kids and was pursuing a second master's degree.

Shari Baloch, 30, became the first woman suicide bomber of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) when she blew herself up and killed four people, including three Chinese teachers at the Karachi University.

The married mother-of-two carried out the suicide attack outside the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi on Tuesday. She has been dominating the headlines, not only because of the nature of her deadly attack in Pakistan's largest city, but also due to her unusual profile for a suicide bomber.

Shari has been described in reports as highly-educated - possessing an MSc in Zoology and pursuing an MPhil in Education. Other reports listed slightly different but equally impressive qualifications.

She was reportedly working as a science teacher in a secondary school. Other reports said she was a primary school teacher.

She was married to a dentist, Habitan Bashir Baloch, and she had two children, a girl and a boy: Mahrosh (8) and Meer Hassan (4).

Habitan expressed pride over his late wife's actions, taking to Twitter to write: ""Shari Jan, your selfless act has left me speechless but I am also beaming with pride today.

""Mahroch and Meer Hassan will grow into very proud humans thinking what a great woman their mother was. You will continue to remain an important part of our lives.""

Shari hailed from Niazar Abad, in the Turbat district of Balochistan, Pakistan's poorest province and a decades-long hotbed of separatist insurgency.

The BLA said she had volunteered for the attack targeting China, whose investment projects in Balochistan the militant group opposes.

It is believed Shari may have volunteered for the attack in revenge for her father's ""enforced"" disappearance.

Abdul Waheed Qamber was reportedly picked up by Pakistani soldiers when Baloch was just a little girl. His whereabouts are said to remain unknown to this day.

She reportedly failed in her repeated legal efforts and even days-long hunger strikes to get her father - who she said had committed no crime - returned."
"BEIJING 鈥?Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday that Pakistan has promised to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for Tuesday's suicide bomb attack in Karachi.

He said that China trusts Pakistan will take effective measures to strengthen security for Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in the country. Wang made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday.

Three Chinese language teachers and their Pakistani driver were killed in the bombing in Karachi this week.

The blast ripped through their minibus, injuring at least four others near the university's Confucius institute.

The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) said it attacked the vehicle carrying the Chinese staff, and that the suicide bomber had been a woman.

The group opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, saying locals do not benefit."

During the meeting Fazlur Rehman strongly condemned the attack of terrorists on Chinese citizens and said that such coward acts can never spoil Pakistan and China relationship, He said Pakistan and its people were standing by Chinese bereaved families. Later on, Maulana Fazlur Rehman wrote his feelings in guest book.

The terrorism incident took place outside the University of Karachi鈥檚 (KU) Confucius institute in which at least four people, including three Chinese nationals were killed while four others were injured. Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had visited the Chinese Embassy and met with Chinese Charge d鈥橝ffaires Ms Pang Chunxue to express his grief and condolences over the deaths of Chinese nationals in the attack at Karachi University. The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack."
A video statement of the online cab driver who has been taken into custody in connection with the Karachi University suicide attack, has surfaced. According to the statement given by the driver, the female suicide bomber had gone to Delhi Colony from Regent Plaza on April 22 along with her husband and children in his cab. According to details, an investigation is underway into the suicide bombing of a van of Chinese teachers outside the Confucius institute at Karachi University last Tuesday. During the investigation, initial statement of the detained driver has been recorded. He stated that he was waiting at Sindhi Muslim Society for passenger when he received a booking in the name of Habitaan.
"The federal government was considering suspending former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's sentence, revealed interior minister Rana Sanaullah during an exclusive interview to a private news channel.

In response to a question regarding the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo, the interior minister stated on Saturday that reducing a sentence or suspending it entirely was within the purview of the federal government.

鈥淎n innocent man has been wrongly accused, he [Nawaz Sharif] should be granted the opportunity to plead his case before a court,鈥?the minister said.

Sanaullah added that the PML-N chief should be involved in the next election campaign, while Maryam Nawaz would be in charge of leading it.

In 2019, Nawaz was allowed to leave the country by courts for medical treatment on the assurance that he would return to Pakistan as soon as he received the required treatment, to complete his ten-year jail term.

Read Govt issues 鈥榦rdinary鈥?passport to Nawaz

However, since his departure from Pakistan, his medical condition for which Pakistani courts had accorded him an exceptional relief of allowing him to leave and travel to London for treatment, was seen by the then Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government as manipulated.

In his interview, Sanaullah also announced that the federal government was considering amending the Constitution to allow a presiding officer to administer oath to a chief minister or the prime minister, instead of leaving the duty at the behest of a governor.

The home minister stated that the powers vested in the office of the governor were remnants of colonial-era 鈥渟ervitude鈥? adding that it should be abolished to allow presiding officers to swear-in the elected heads.

The minister's remarks come in light of the deadlock witnessed in the Punjab Assembly after the election of Hamza Shehbaz to the post of chief minister.

Punjab Governor Omer Sarfraz Cheema refused the suggestions of Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti to administer oath to chief minister-elect Hamza Shahbaz.

The LHC chief justice had 鈥渟uggested/advised/proposed鈥?the governor to complete the process of administering the oath, either by himself or through his nominee. However, after deliberations with legal and constitutional experts, the governor decided not to accept the advice of the court of law.

After a long, drawn-out legal and political battle, Hamza was finally sworn-in as the Punjab chief minister 鈥?hours after Cheema dismissed former provincial chief executive Usman Buzdar鈥檚 resignation, saying it was ""not constitutionally valid"".

NAB's future

Responding to a query regarding the future of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Sanaullah stated that some members of the current government believed that 鈥淣AB should be wrapped up鈥? However, he added that some were of the belief that such an act would hurt the government politically.

KU Confucius institute attack

In response to a question regarding foreign interference in the University of Karachi suicide blast, Rana Sanaullah stated that the attack was 鈥渁bsolutely an effort to destabilise Pakistan.鈥?
The minister added that the law enforcement agencies will be successful in 鈥渄igging out鈥?the networks involved in the tragedy.

鈥淚t is unfortunate that a well-educated family was involved in the attack,鈥?the minister added, stating that it contradicted the perception that terrorism is borne of poverty or illiteracy.

The minister was referring to Shari Baloch, a female suicide bomber who was part of the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), that claimed responsibility for the attack that killed four people including three Chinese nationals."
"WASHINGTON 鈥?The US government has condemned the terrorist attack at Karachi University that killed four people including three Chinese nationals.

At his press briefing in Washington DC, the US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price deplored the attack while terming it a 鈥渢rue affront to mankind鈥?

""A terrorist attack anywhere is an affront to humanity everywhere, but for a terrorist attack to take place at a university, or at a religious site, or at some of the locations we鈥檝e seen recently 鈥?that is a true affront to mankind,"" Price commented.

He said that the United States has expressed determination to work together with Pakistan in areas of mutual interests including counterterrorism and border security.

Ned Price said that his country values the bilateral relationship with Pakistan.

""When it comes to your question, what I鈥檒l say is that we value our bilateral relationship. We want to continue to work together in areas where we do have mutual interests with our Pakistani partners. That includes counterterrorism. That includes border security as well,"" the US State Department spokesperson said.

"ISLAMABAD: The multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has helped sow the seeds of love among young Pakistanis.

During the festival of Eidul Fitr, Chinese workers at various CPEC projects across the country felt the delight their Pakistani colleagues did and made the day very special for them.

Syed Farukh Shah, an employee of the Engro Thar Coal Power Project in the Tharparkar district of Sindh, spent the festival at the workplace due to doing his duty.

Shah was overwhelmed with emotions when his Chinese fellow workers from the China Machinery Engineering Corporation greeted him in the morning 鈥?just like his family did during the festival at home.

鈥淚 was away from home and missing my family, but the way they greeted us and celebrated our festival was incredible. They shared sweets with us, gave us gifts, and hosted a dinner party for us.鈥?
The coal power project is one of the major power plants in Pakistan to help the country meet its electricity demands. The project has completed the second phase of mining, allowing it to generate 660 MW of power using locally available coal.

In the coming years, its production capacity will be able to reach 5,000 MW.

To celebrate Eid, which marks the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, the local personnel with the 1,320 MW Sahiwal coal-fired power plant in the Sahiwal district of Pakistan鈥檚 eastern Punjab province received gifts from their Chinese colleagues.

Muhammad Bilal Chaudhry, manager of human resources, told Xinhua that receiving goody bags from Chinese colleagues had made the festival more enjoyable for the local staff.

鈥淚t was a wonderful gesture 鈥?because it demonstrates that the Chinese recognize the significance of the festival for us and extended their congratulations at the festival to make us feel unique,鈥?he said.

Ikram Ullah, a local engineer at the Lahore station of the Matiari-Lahore transmission line project, never expected that one of the most memorable Eids in his life would take place at his workplace far away from his home.

鈥淢y family resides in Quetta, which is 974 km from where I work, but it was with no doubt one of the best Eids of my life. My Chinese coworkers took excellent care of us on Eid and we shared the joy to the fullest.鈥?
The day at the Lahore station started with a special breakfast for locals, followed by meetings and greetings and a luncheon to celebrate the festival, the engineer said.

鈥淭he best part started in the afternoon when Pakistanis and Chinese played Pakistan鈥檚 favourite sport cricket as part of the celebrations, and distributed Eid gifts among the players,鈥?he said.

The project of the 878 km-long power transmission line has been completed by the Pak Matiari-Lahore Transmission Company (Pvt) Limited, on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis for a term of 25 years. The project will transport power from the new generating units located in the south, including Thar coal-based projects.

The flagship project under the CPEC started commercial operation as scheduled in September 2021.

Local experts praise the CPEC project as beginning with the goal of increasing economic cooperation and strengthening Pakistan鈥檚 financial situation and serving as a bond of friendship between Pakistan and China.

鈥淏oth Chinese and Pakistanis are learning about each other鈥檚 culture and values as a result of the CPEC,鈥?Muhammad Abdul Mateen, a Chinese language teacher at the Confucius institute in the National University of Modern Languages in Islamabad, told Xinhua.

Mateen said the interest shown by Pakistani students in Chinese culture and language has astounded him from time to time, and he is convinced that the CPEC has not only shown Pakistan the way to prosperity, but also helped sow the seeds of love for Chinese culture in the hearts of young Pakistanis."

"ISLAMABAD: The Counterterrorism Department (CTD) Monday arrested a would-be woman suicide bomber planning to target a Chinese motorcade in Balochistan.

According to the CTD, the female suicide bomber belonged to the Majeed Brigade wing of the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA).

It was the BLA whose female suicide bomber had carried out an attack at the University of Karachi鈥檚 Confucius institute in April, killing three Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver. The security officials also recovered explosives and detonators from the alleged suicide bomber.

The law enforcement agencies said that the arrested suicide bomber was planning to target Chinese officials on the route of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Following the arrest, the CTD is also conducting raids at different places to arrest other militants belonging to the group, according to media reports.

The reported arrest comes the same day as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif phoned his Chinese counterpart Mr Li Keqiang and assured him extraordinary security measures for the Chinese nationals in across Pakistan.

Officials blame hostile intelligence agencies for funding, training and equipping the Baloch terrorist groups and tasking them to target the Chinese nationals and installations in and around Balochistan.

The prevention of yet another terrorist attack against China-Pakistan cooperation in less than a month is significant, experts told Global Times, which demonstrates the Pakistani government鈥檚 commitment to stopping terrorism and preserving cooperation between the two countries.

BEIJING - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has a portfolio of projects in different provinces in Pakistan, depending upon their requirements and their areas of competency.

And based on different comparative advantages, every province will develop its own cluster of industries, Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal said in an exclusive interview with China Economic Net (CEN). As the minister put it, such a portfolio will bring more investment and create more employment opportunities for the youth from that province.

Take Balochistan as an example. CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) is focusing on the development of Gwadar, where it also provides - besides developing the port infrastructure - facilities for medical care, education, technical education and livelihood of the locals. 鈥淲e are also working to provide clean drinking water to people of Gwadar and also a power generation station to generate electricity for the area,鈥?Ahsan Iqbal further said. 鈥淐PEC connects Pakistan with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China. And through BRI and CPEC, Pakistan can be linked with the global supply chains more easily,鈥?the minister pinpointed. At the moment, many jobs are being relocated from China to countries where cheaper labour is available. And Pakistan with the CPEC connectivity has a very good opportunity to absorb most of this relocation.

鈥淲e hope that when the special economic zones in each province are ready, they will attract considerable investment in the relocation of Chinese industry that will bring more job opportunities in the region and also help Pakistan move up on the industrialization part,鈥?Ahsan Iqbal added.

In the second phase of China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA-II), China has bought down tariffs to zero for Pakistan on 313 high-priority tariff lines. The new FTA, the minister noted, offered more opportunities for promoting trade between both countries.

Federal minister for planning sees greater cooperation between Pakistani and Chinese enterprises in coming years

However, the challenge faced by Pakistani businessmen and enterprises is to enter China with more information and knowledge about its market. Traditionally Pakistani enterprises have been doing business with Europe and the United States and they had little understanding of the Chinese market. But now the chambers of commerce and industries are being guided, and they are being encouraged to have closer cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.

鈥淎s I see it in coming years, there will be greater cooperation between Pakistani and Chinese enterprises,鈥?said the minister. And this offers great promise in light of the long term plan of CPEC that envisages cooperation in all dimensions of economy, agriculture, industry, technology, service, education, health and so on.

鈥淲e hope that this cooperation will fully blossom in all areas and there will be greater connectivity between China and Pakistan,鈥?Ahsan Iqbal told CEN. However, 鈥淲e must be mindful that there are some forces which are enemy of CPEC, which do not want CPEC to move forward,鈥?the minister said. While strongly condemning the terrorist attack on a shuttle van of Confucius institute at the University of Karachi last month, he said that the government has devised a strategy for greater coordination amongst all security agencies and organizations to ensure foolproof security to the Chinese working on CPEC projects.

The minister noted, the best way to defeat such forces is not to let such incident impact the speed of CPEC and to further increase the implementation of CPEC so that they get the message that through such cowardly acts, they will not be able to stop the progress of CPEC."

During the call, PM Shehbaz affirmed his government鈥檚 firm resolve to fast-track both the ongoing as well as the new projects under the multibillion-dollar project China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Both sides exchanged views on Pakistan-China all-weather strategic cooperative partnership to serve the vital interests of the peoples of the neighboring countries, as well as the broader interests of peace and stability in the region.

Recalling sister-city partnerships between the two sides, PM further expressed his desire to learn from the experience of those Chinese officials, who have remained instrumental in setting up Special economic zones in their provinces."
"KARACHI 鈥?China has called back its instructors teaching at Confucius institutes in different cities of Pakistan days after three Chinese nationals were killed in a suicide attack at the University of Karachi, it emerged on Monday.

The Confucius institutes, which are run as non-profit educational institutions, were established in different cities with collaboration of Pakistan and Chinese universities.

The institutes are committed to providing Chinese language and cultural teaching resources and services to people in Pakistan.

An official of the Karachi鈥檚 Confucius institute told Geo News that Chinese instructors have left for their country after the attack.

He said that the educational activities will continue with the help of Pakistani teachers, adding that the department is also considering an option to hold online classes and exams for Mandrin language.

On April 26, a female suicide bomber blew herself up near a van outside the Confucius institutes at the Karachi University, leaving four people, including three Chinese teachers, dead and four others injured.

A banned outfit had claimed the responsibility for the attack. The security agencies have launched an operation against elements involved in the deadly attack."

"It was widely propagated that Pakistan has valiantly surmounted the challenge of terrorism and for a time it was acknowledged that terrorists were retreating.

The people felt reassured that the country has overcome this scourge and they felt free to move about without fear of a sudden terrorist-inflicted outrage.

This fact was also recognised internationally encouraging the holding of cricket matches in the country. However, slowly people started witnessing the resurgence of terrorism that initially was confined to outer reaches of the border area but then the urban areas began to become targets of terrorist activities in the country.

Almost all major cities of the country were subjected to outrages perpetrated by the terrorists and suddenly nothing felt safe anymore.

Be it the Karachi University attack, the Saddar blast or the blast in Karachi鈥檚 famous Bolton Market, everyone is worried about terrorists getting active in Pakistan and mini-Pakistan (i.e.Karachi).

WATCH: Son kept on calling dead mother after Bolton Market blast

The biggest terrorist incident took place in Karachi University where least four people, including three Chinese nationals, were killed while four others were injured in a suicide attack outside the Confucius institute of Karachi University (KU).

The blast took place at approximately 2:30pm and a spokesperson for the university confirmed that three of the victims were Chinese nationals identifying them as Confucius institute Director Huang Guiping, Ding Mupeng, Chen Sai and Khalid, the driver.

The spokesperson also identified two of the injured as Wang Yuqing and Hamid and two other faculty members. Confucius institute is a Chinese government-run body which offers language and cultural programmes overseas in Karachi.

Television footage showed a white van in flames with plumes of smoke rising from its remains while the windows of nearby buildings were shattered. The van appeared to be turning towards the Confucius institute, located next to the commerce department, when the incident took place.

CCTV footage of the attack showed a burqa-clad woman standing outside the entrance of the Confucius institute.

The woman detonated herself just as the van neared the institute鈥檚 entrance. The BLA released a photo of a woman in fatigues raising two fingers in salute who it said had carried out the attack, and named her as Shari Baloch alias Bramsh.

Local media reported that the bomber had been a student at the university.

Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) mentioned that the suicide attack was carried out by a woman, adding that ball bearings were found at the site of the blast. It was also reported that the van was properly guarded as a Rangers team was escorting it which was why an improvised explosive device (IED) was not used instead.

The blast ripped through the minibus, injuring at least four others near the university鈥檚 Confucius institute. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) said it attacked the vehicle carrying the Chinese staff, and that the suicide bomber had been a woman.

The group opposes Chinese investment in Pakistan, saying locals do not benefit. It was the first time a suicide attack by the BLA has been carried out by a female militant. The group has targeted Chinese nationals on a number of occasions, as has the Pakistani Taliban.

China is heavily involved in large infrastructure projects across Pakistan, including in resource-rich Balochistan province.

The BLA has targeted Chinese nationals in attacks in the past.

This was the first major attack on Chinese nationals in Pakistan since the bombing of a bus at Dasu in the northwest in July 2021 that killed nine Chinese nationals. However, that attack wasn鈥檛 claimed by the Baloch militants. The Pakistani Taliban 鈥?also known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan 鈥?had claimed responsibility for the attack.

Four Pakistanis had also died in that attack.

The Baloch separatist guerrillas, who say they are fighting for a greater share in regional resources of mines and minerals, usually attack gas projects, infrastructure and the security forces. They also attack Chinese projects and workers despite Pakistan鈥檚 assurances that it is doing everything it can to protect the projects.

The embassy of China in Pakistan confirmed that three of the country鈥檚 citizens had been killed in the blast. Pakistan鈥檚 government condemned what it called a cowardly terrorist attack. Under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor China is in the process of transforming Balochistan, rich in natural resources but Pakistan鈥檚 poorest province through major Chinese infrastructure projects comprising a network of roads, railway and pipelines between the two countries which forms part of Beijing鈥檚 ambitious Belt and Road initiative.

The most worrying aspect of the latest surge in terrorism is that it is directed towards Pak-China friendship and collaboration.

In this context, this is not the first of its kind of terrorist outrage but is the latest in the series of such attacks. Earlier, at least two children were killed in a suicide attack targeting a vehicle carrying Chinese nationals in Balochistan鈥檚 Gwadar district.

Three people, including the car鈥檚 driver, were also injured when a suicide bomber blew himself near the vehicle. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

The incident came less than two weeks after a motorcycle bomb blast took place at Quetta鈥檚 Hali Road roundabout, near Balo卢chistan Assembly and the High Court, leaving two policemen martyred and 21 others, including 12 policemen, injured.

There have been other attacks targeting Chinese nationals in the country. A Chinese engineer who lived in Karachi was shot at and wounded in a moving car by gunmen riding a motorcycle in the city鈥檚 SITE area where he was supposed to repair imported machinery.

The banned Balochistan Liberation Front had claimed responsibility for that attack.

The most serious of such terrorist attack took place in Dasu area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa鈥檚 Upper Kohistan district in which thirteen people, including nine Chinese nationals, two personnel of the Frontier Constabulary (FC) and two locals, were killed and 28 others sustained injuries when a coach carrying them to an under-construction tunnel site of the 4,300-megawatt Dasu hydropower project fell into a ravine in the Upper Kohistan area after an explosion.

According to eyewitnesses, three vehicles were on their way to the Dasu dam site in a convoy after picking up Chinese labourers in the morning from Barseen camp 鈥?some eight kilometres from Dasu district headquarters of Upper Kohistan 鈥?via the Karakoram Highway when the blast occurred.

Sources also mentioned that a Chinese national was missing and search for his whereabouts was under way. Soon after the incident, army helicopters airlifted the bodies and the injured, including 33 Chinese nationals, to the Combined Military Hospitals in Abbottabad and Gilgit.

In the meantime, the FC personnel cordoned off the area until police and other investigating agencies arrived at the spot and started geo-fencing the area. WAPDA Chairman retired Lt. Gen Muzammil Hussain rushed to Dasu and monitored the rescue and relief operation at the

site.

Initially there were conflicting reports about the cause of the tragic incident with the Pakistani side attributing the incident to unfortunate accident but later conceded that it was terrorist activity directed towards the Chinese.

This turn of event is indeed a great cause of concern as if the terrorists keep on targeting the Chinese then it will become difficult for the Chinese to keep on investing and working for infrastructure development of Pakistan.

"QUETTA 鈥?A terror suspect, identified as Noor Jehan, was arrested along with an alleged member of banned Balochistan Liberation Army鈥檚 Majeed Brigade during a raid in Turbat, confirms a spokesperson of the Balochistan government.

Addressing a presser on Wednesday, Farah Azeem Shah said that the Counter-Terrorism Department officials conducted a raid in Hoshab town of Balochistan on May 16 in which a suspected militant was detained along with her partner.

A suicide jacket, six hand grenades, and explosive material were recovered from the militants.

Meanwhile, a case has been registered against the detained terrorists while seven-day remand was also given by the local court.

According to the Balochistan government spokesperson, the detained woman made startling revelations about the terror activities in the sparsely populated region.

Noor Jehan disclosed that the wife of late Aslam alias Uccho鈥檚 was training more women to carry out terrorist acts against armed forces and foreign nationals.

The detained militant also revealed that she received funds from a Dubai-based man namely Nadeem. BLA鈥檚 Majeed Brigade is training more women for a suicide bombing in Pakistan.

Shah said that foreign hands are involved in the recent wave of terrorism in Pakistan. Terrorist attacks are being carried out at the behest of people residing abroad, she added.

Earlier this month, a woman suicide bomber of the same banned outfit claimed responsibility of killing four people including three Chinese nationals, in an attack on a minibus carrying staff from the Confucius institute at Karachi University."
"China and Pakistan are very close neighbors connected by mountains and rivers, and are indestructible iron-clad brothers with a shared future. Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, China-Pakistan relations have continued to forge ahead, and have always maintained robust vigor despite the changes of the international situation.

Year 2021 marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan. More than 100 celebrations were held, which injected new vitality into China-Pakistan relations. The world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. China and Pakistan are both at a critical period of national development. It is an inevitable choice for the two countries to join hands and move forward together to build a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era. The all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between China and Pakistan is unique. The friendship between the two sides will be passed on from generation to generation and will not be shaken or changed by a single event.

China always regards its ties with Pakistan as a priority in its diplomacy with neighboring countries. China will firmly support Pakistan in defending national sovereignty and security, maintaining unity, achieving stability, development and prosperity.

The all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between China and Pakistan is unique. The friendship between the two sides will be passed on from generation to generation and will not be shaken or changed by a single event.

Developing amicable relations with China has always been a common perception in Pakistan that transcends all political differences and enjoys a high degree of agreement throughout the country. The two countries and two militaries have maintained the momentum of close high-level exchanges, strengthened strategic communication and jointly led the direction of China-Pakistan relations. In February this year, President Xi Jinping met with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in Beijing during his visit to China to attend the Opening Ceremony of 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Recently, Premier Li Keqiang talked over phone with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and had an in-depth exchange of views on bilateral ties. In March, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Pakistan and the Chinese Foreign Minister attended the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers for the first time in history. Pakistan鈥檚 Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will make his first official bilateral visit to China on 21 May, the anniversary day that China and Pakistan established diplomatic relations. On 11 March, the first batch of six J-10C was formally inducted to Pakistan Air Force. The Pakistani political and military leadership praised this grand military cooperation project as another important symbol of China-Pakistan all-weather friendship, and will strongly boost the new development of Pakistani military capacity.

Under the strategic planning of President Xi Jinping, the CPEC has been expanded in an all-round way, entering a new stage of enrichment and expansion. The two sides have initiated or completed 46 of the 70 early-harvest projects with a total investment of 25.4 billion US dollars. The CPEC improved has Pakistan鈥檚 infrastructure, which is playing a major role in the economic development of the country. New breakthroughs keep flourishing in industrial cooperation. The East Bay Expressway of Gwadar Port has been completed and will open for traffic soon. This year, China donated another 3,000 sets of solar panel to Gwadar people, which brings the total number of donation to 7,000 sets. The construction of a desalination plant aided by China will start soon in Gwadar. Two units of the Karot Hydropower project have started to provide stable and clean power to Pakistan鈥檚 power grid since May. After its full operation, its four units will provide electricity for 5 million people. The two countries stand ready to further synergize development strategies, firmly advance the development of CPEC, hold a new round of CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee meeting in due course, implement the Framework Agreement on Industrial Cooperation, strengthen cooperation in industries, people鈥檚 livelihood and agriculture, and jointly implement high quality development of CPEC with new Pakistan speed.

After the terrorist attack on a van of the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi on April 26, Pakistani President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly, leaders of various political parties and people from all sectors unanimously condemned the terrorist attack. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan to convey condolences at the earliest opportunity and sent a letter of condolence to the Chinese leaders. The Pakistani cabinet has decided to take unprecedented measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in Pakistan. China fully recognizes this.

The governments and leaders of China and Pakistan have agreed that the two countries should take immediate action and adopt firm and effective measures to deal with it. The pressing task is to speed up the investigation and hunting down of the perpetrators and give exemplary punishment to them as soon as possible. Targeted measures need to be taken to improve security protection for Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan. Efforts should be made to give timely security warnings, and plug security loopholes so as to prevent similar incidents from happening again. China will continue to support Pakistan in enhancing its counter-terrorism capacity, and stands ready to make joint efforts with Pakistan to thwart any attempt to undermine China-Pakistan relations.

We are proud of our deeply rooted friendship. People-to-people exchanges between the two countries will not be deterred by any terrorism. The Confucius institutes in Pakistan will continue to teach Chinese to Pakistani students through various means to promote the traditional friendship between the two countries. People-to-people and cultural exchanges between our two countries will never stop, the hearts of the two peoples will become closer.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan 70 years ago, no matter how the international situation changes, the two sides have always shown each other with sincerity and shared weal and woe. China is firmly committed to advancing China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and jointly addressing international and regional challenges. I believe that with joint efforts of both sides, the building of a China-Pakistan community with a shared future will surely take new and firm steps!

To celebrate 71st anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the Information Minister, the Chinese Charge d鈥?Affaires and Secretary Information and Broadcasting Shahera Shahid cut the cake. The Minister also recorded her impressions in the visitors鈥?book."
"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and China have reaffirmed their strong support for each other鈥檚 core interests and major concerns and commitment to deepening strategic communication including at the highest political level and practical cooperation. They also agreed to building an even stronger China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, said a joint statement issued on Sunday at the conclusion of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari鈥檚 two-day official visit to China.

Foreign minister Bilawal visited Guangzhou on May 21-22 at the invitation of State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. It was his first official bilateral visit after assuming the office of foreign minister of Pakistan.

The visit coincided with the 71st anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Pakistan. During the visit, the state councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi and foreign minister Bilawal held in-depth discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations as well as regional and international issues of shared interest. The talks were conducted in a warm and friendly atmosphere, in line with the finest tradition of mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries.

The joint statement said the two sides agreed that amidst profound regional and international changes, the importance of China-Pakistan strategic relations has assumed even greater significance.

鈥淎s All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partners, China and Pakistan share ironclad mutual trust and friendship, which is a source of peace, stability, and prosperity for the region and beyond,鈥?it was added.

The two sides noted with satisfaction the steady growth of economic cooperation between China and Pakistan. In this context, they agreed that China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has effectively improved Pakistan鈥檚 infrastructure and boosted its socio-economic development. 鈥淏oth sides expressed firm resolve to synergizing development strategies, pushing forward all CPEC projects in a safe, smooth, and high-quality manner, promoting cooperation in areas such as economy and trade, investment, industry, agriculture, health, and science and technology, contributing to the peoples鈥?well-being and delivering greater benefits to local communities,鈥?the statement said.

The two sides expressed satisfaction at the growing momentum of bilateral defense cooperation and exchanges. They underlined that China-Pakistan defense cooperation was in fact a factor of peace and stability in the region. The two sides termed terrorism as the common enemy of humanity.

The two sides called on the regional countries and the international community to form synergy and fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The two sides expressed their determination not to allow anyone to damage China-Pakistan iron brotherhood. They once again strongly condemned the Karachi University Confucius institute terrorist attack.

Pakistan reiterated that efforts would be made to speed up investigation, hunt down the culprits, and bring them to justice. Pakistan briefed the Chinese side on its efforts to ensure the safety of all Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in the country. China appreciated Pakistan鈥檚 commitment to the safety and security of Chinese nationals.

Pakistan and China would further enhance counter-terrorism and security cooperation. In the face of multiple traditional and non-traditional global challenges, the two sides agreed on the need for international cooperation and solidarity.

They noted that, based on the principles of win-win cooperation and shared benefits, Belt and Road cooperation has become an open and inclusive platform for international cooperation and is widely welcomed as a global public good."
"ISLAMABAD: China on Monday said that no matter how the international landscape may evolve, China-Pakistan relations will remain unshakable.

Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told a regular briefing that the recent visit of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari who took China as the first destination of his official bilateral visits after assuming his post fully shows that the new government of Pakistan is committed to developing our all-weather strategic cooperative partnership.

鈥淐hina highly appreciates this. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held productive talks with Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and they issued a joint statement,鈥?he said.

Wang Wenbin said that the two sides reached important consensus in the following five aspects.

鈥淔irst, both sides agreed that the China-Pakistan friendship has endured for a long time and is full of vitality, the bilateral relations are rock-solid, and the solidarity and cooperation between the two sides has become an important stabilizing factor in a turbulent and changing world,鈥?he said.

Second, he added, both sides agreed that any terrorist attack against Chinese citizens in Pakistan is unacceptable, any despicable attempt to undermine China-Pakistan friendship is doomed to fail, and incidents such as the terrorist attack on the Confucius institute in Karachi must not recur.

鈥淭hird, both sides agreed that all-round cooperation between China and Pakistan enjoys fruitful results and broad prospects. The two sides will seek greater synergy between their development strategies, further tap into the potential of economic cooperation, and push forward all CPEC projects in a safe, smooth, and high-quality manner,鈥?he added.

Fourth, Wang Wenbin said, both sides agreed that the world has entered a period of turbulence and transformation, and more than ever, the international community yearns for peace and development.

鈥淐hina highly appreciates the fact that Pakistan was among the first to lend support to the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative. China is ready to work with other countries in the world to focus on the development agenda, meet security challenges, implement the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and join hands to build a community with a shared future for mankind,鈥?he added.

Fifth, he added, both sides agreed that the sound situation of peace, stability, cooperation and development in Asia is attributable to the joint efforts of regional countries and needs to be cherished all the more.

鈥淲e call on all parties to respect each other, treat each other as equals, conduct win-win cooperation, and oppose the Cold War mentality, zero-sum game and bloc confrontation,鈥?he added.

Chinese foreign ministry official said that State Councilor Wang stressed that China and Pakistan are true friends sharing weal and woe and good brothers having a heart-to-heart affinity.

鈥淭he friendship between China and Pakistan is jointly nurtured by several generations of leaders of the two countries鈥?

鈥淐hina is ready to, as always, prioritize Pakistan in its neighborhood diplomacy, continuously consolidate the 鈥榠ronclad鈥?friendship between China and Pakistan, let the building of a China-Pakistan community with a shared future take root, make China-Pakistan relations a powerful stabilizing factor in the region, and enable China-Pakistan cooperation to provide more robust vitality for regional development and revitalization,鈥?he concluded."
"Is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) going as planned? Since it was launched in 2013, the flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has been under the watchful eye of regional and global powers, and an occasional target for terrorists.

Pakistan has hinged its economic progress on the rapid implementation of CPEC. Initially valued at $47 billion, the value of CPEC projects was worth $62 billion as of 2021. Since 2018 onwards, however, it was not been smooth sailing under the PTI government as far as work on CPEC was concerned. While a number of armed attacks on Chinese officials working in Pakistan over the years failed to make a dent in the progress of the project, work on the corridor seemed to have hit a snag under the PTI government.

We have also seen recent attacks on Chinese citizens in Pakistan. The suicide bombing at the Karachi University Confucius institute on April 26 and earlier at a bus carrying Chinese workers near the Dasu hydropower plant in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in July 2021 are a case in point.

The government of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has vowed that it will take CPEC forward with a new vigour. Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has also reaffirmed Pakistan鈥檚 resolve to further strengthen its strategic ties with China, including through the implementation of CPEC. Bilawal has emphasised that Pakistan will increase cooperation with China through CPEC to not just achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but also to participate in the work of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) Group of Friends for a peaceful and shared future.

With the change in the political setup, the change in the pace of development is discernible. After the tables were turned on the PTI government and a new one was formed with the PML-N鈥檚 Shehbaz Sharif as the prime minister, the newly appointed planning minister, Ahsan Iqbal, was quick to announce a security review meeting to be held every month on CPEC and urged that CPEC could enable Pakistan to become an industrial economy. Chairing a meeting, he lamented that the momentum between 2013-18 could not be sustained by the PTI government. He also pointed to the fact that Pakistan鈥檚 side of CPEC鈥檚 Joint Working Group on Security did not hold regular meetings.

It is in this backdrop that soon after coming to power, the new government announced it was going to abolish the CPEC Authority, declaring it a waste of resources and a hurdle in the speedy implementation of the CPEC. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal鈥檚 first briefing on the state of CPEC blew the lid off the claims of the previous government that everything was fine as far as the project was concerned. He was told that over 37 per cent of the installed capacity of the CPEC power projects, or 1,980 megawatts, was out of order due to non-payment of dues to the Chinese investors. He was informed that the total receivables of the 10 Chinese IPPs had increased to Rs300 billion.

Since the incumbent government has only limited time before the general elections are announced after it completes its tenure 鈥?which it has said it will till now 鈥?it can at least work to move things in the right direction for the next government as far as CPEC is concerned. Besides other areas, Pakistan sees great potential for development in its agriculture, energy, industrial and transport sectors under the project. Pakistan can learn from the Chinese experience of modernising its agriculture sector, focusing on corporate farming, new seed development for increasing crop yield, introduction of new varieties of agriculture products, and establishing agro-industry. Experts have proposed agri technology zones to enhance cooperation in this field. The cooperation between Faisalabad Agriculture University and Chinese universities is a very good starting point.

Another good news is that the Global Innovation Centre (GIC), an organization based in China, is planning to set up an office in Pakistan and a China-Pakistan Trade, Energy, and Investment Centre in the organisation鈥檚 Shenzhen office. GIC, which works in the areas of international cooperation in technology; incubation of new businesses; scientific and technological industrial zones and training of entrepreneurs, has offices in ten countries, including the US, UK, Indonesia, and Thailand.

China鈥檚 cooperation with Pakistan in the field of solar energy is also a ray of hope for replacing coal-powered energy gradually. In April this year, C&D Clean Energy, based in China, announced a partnership with Integra Solar in Pakistan for panel supply chain services. According to the reported memorandum of understanding, C&D Clean Energy will provide Pakistan's company with integrated supply chain services of 100MW solar modules in 2022. There鈥檚 a lot of room for cooperation in this field at a time when rising temperatures is a global environmental concern.

Infrastructure projects are a mainstay for the progress of a developing country. The 392 kilometres-long Sukkur-Multan motorway, for instance, has been regarded as a part of the largest transport infrastructure project of CPEC. Passing through rural and mostly under-developed areas of Pakistan, the project provided jobs to about 30,000 people at one time and quick transportation for villagers.

In another development, in April this year, 120 hybrid buses left China for Karachi and other cities of Sindh. These buses have now reached Karachi. This development is expected to address one of the most serious problems faced by the people in Karachi 鈥?lack of public transport. The Orange Line Metro Train (OLMT) in Lahore is another example of an affordable and decent commuting option.

The most notable development would be the completion of the ML-1 project, negotiations for which are going on with the Chinese government. ML-1, which initially cost $9 billion was later revised downwards to $6.8 billion.

Pakistan Railways is expected to transport over 20 per cent of the country鈥檚 freight business after the completion of Main Line-I (ML-I) under CPEC which would help make the department a profitable entity. According to reports, Pakistan Railways transports only four per cent of freight traffic in the country. ML-I is a 1872-kilometer long track from Peshawar to Karachi and is expected to create around 24,000 jobs with a train speed of 160 kilometres per hour.

But all these developments will not make their full impact unless the benefits of these projects trickle down to the common man in a true sense. Indeed, only inclusive development is true development.

President Arif Alvi has approved posthumous Tamgha-e-Imtiaz for three Chinese teachers who died in a suicide attack at the University of Karachi鈥檚 Confucius institute

The posthumous Tamgha-e-Imtiaz was recommended for the Chinese teachers in recognition of their services in strengthening the Pakistan-China friendship and improving education and cultural exchanges between the two countries.

The awards have been given under Article 259 of the Constitution and Decorations Act, 1975.

Four people including three Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in attack on a van carrying Chinese teachers of Confucius institute at University of Karachi.

According to initial reports, a van carrying teachers-mostly Chinese nationals- caught fire after a blast near the Confucius institute leaving a number of passengers and security personnel injured.

The van, was carrying Chinese teachers from their residence inside Karachi University premises to Confucius institute- a non-profit institute teaching Chinese language.

A female suicide bomber belonging to a banned nationalist outfit was found involved in the attack as CCTV footage also showed her blowing herself near the vehicle.

Police is searching for suicide bomber Shari Baloch鈥檚 husband Habitan Bashir and his accomplices in the case.

A terror financing case has been registered against Habitan Bashir and other accused in Karachi University suicide attack. Police Inspector Sanaullah has been complainant in the case against the accused.

Habitan Bashir and others nominated in the case, have been accused of providing funds for April 26 suicide attack in the university."
"In this crucial time when our country is facing economic instability, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) 鈥?with a massive $62 billion investment plan 鈥?can play a key role as a 鈥榞ame changer鈥?for the national economy, especially for the development and prosperity of Balochistan.

The significance of this multi-billion-dollar corridor is, however, poorly understood. This is a flagship project under China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), designed to connect more than 60 countries across Asia, Europe and Africa. CPEC promises to open up new vistas of socio-economic development and employment opportunities for the people of Balochistan.

We can say that Balochistan, and Gwadar in particular, is the linchpin of this mega project. This project will contribute to the development of the whole province and address various economic and social problems there. Gwadar will be transformed into an economic hub after the completion of several projects under CPEC. It is heartening to see that more countries are taking advantage of the investment opportunities offered by the special economic zones there. With the construction of the western route of CPEC, property value has skyrocketed in areas where these roads have been built. Other cities like Qalat, Quetta and Zhob will also become more vibrant with the completion of the planned road network which will give a boost to economic activities and other development projects under CPEC.

Numerous road and transport, energy, education and training, industrial and other socio-economic projects are also being carried out under CPEC. Energy projects include a 320MW China Hub Coal Power Project, and 300MW Coal-Fired Power Project at Gwadar. Likewise, connectivity projects encompass the 19km four-lanes East Bay Expressway Gwadar which is near completion, linking the Makran Coastal Highway N-10 to the Gwadar Port. Those under construction are Zhob-Quetta, Kuchlak (N-50), Khuzdar鈥揃asima Road (N-30), Hoshab鈥揂waran Road Section (M-8), Nokundi鈥揗ashkhel Road, Awaran鈥揔huzdar Road Section (M-8), up-gradation of DI Khan (Yarik) 鈥揨hob, N-50 Phase-I, Mashkhel鈥揚anjgur Road and Quetta Mass Transit.

Upgradation and development of fishing, boat-making and maintenance services to protect and promote livelihoods of the local population is being carried out under the Gwadar Livelihood Project. As a matter of fact, CPEC will affect the province economically, commercially as well as geographically. A positive impact is likely to be a step towards mitigation of poverty and reduction of unemployment. It will be a catalyst for change in the shape of reduction of inequities among undeveloped provinces. Soon after PM Shehbaz Sharif took charge as the 23rd prime minister, he turned his attention towards CPEC which had been started by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

In his maiden speech in the National Assembly after winning election, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that his government would speed up the construction of CPEC. He had previously spoken highly of CPEC several times, calling it an ambitious blueprint to transform Pakistan into a major emerging economy so that the less-developed parts of the country could enjoy the dividends of development.

The corridor will not only help and benefit Pakistan and China but the whole region, including Afghanistan, Iran, India, and the Central Asian Republics. Road, rail, and air linkages will lead to a win-win model for all and is considered a real hope for a better future with growth and development of the economy. India and Afghanistan will sooner or later join this project.

Per a market pundit: 鈥淧akistan may have some leverage in Afghanistan, but as far as CPEC is concerned, it cannot afford to miss this once-in-a-lifetime chance, especially when the people of the country are getting desperate for the promised future.""

Unfortunately, there are those that are working on an anti- state agenda with the support of foreign countries and have been trying to undermine the development of the province by targeting state institutions, security forces and also Chinese nationals. In a span of just one month, the city of Karachi witnessed three bombing incidents 鈥?a suicide attack on Chinese teachers at the University of Karachi鈥檚 Confucius institute in which three Chinese language teachers and their driver were killed; and bicycle and motorbike improvised explosive device (IED) blasts in the densely populated Saddar and Kharadar areas targeting Pakistan Coast Guards and police..

Moreover, there is no doubt that CPEC is the game-changer in the region and beyond. Both the Pakistani and Chinese leadership need to place special attention and focus 鈥?with dedication and commitment 鈥?to promoting CPEC and OBOR as a success story. They need to do this with strong political will, wisdom, vision, for real economic growth and common prosperity for the whole region through regional connectivity.

We should strengthen deep strategic cooperation with China and use CPEC to develop infrastructure, hydro-energy resources, and industrial cooperation for real dividends and long-term industrialization. No doubt, CPEC is not only for our economic growth but in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and will bring transformation through regional connectivity.

Some reports have suggested that China wants its own security company to protect its citizens and assets in Pakistan. The move reportedly came from Beijing in the wake of increased attacks against the Chinese nationals.

In July last year, nine Chinese nationals were killed in terrorist attack in Dasu. They were working on a hydroelectric power project. In April this year, three Chinese teachers, working at the Karachi University鈥檚 Confucius institute, were killed in a suicide attack.

Pakistan is believed to have been not in favour of allowing private Chinese security companies to operate instead it has assured Beijing of foolproof security to the Chinese workers in Pakistan."
"KARACHI: The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday arrested an important accused in the Karachi University suicide blast that targeted Chinese teachers, ARY News reported.

In a major development, in the KU blast case, the CTD with the help of technical assistance and other evidence arrested key accused in the case.

Initial interrogation from the accused has been completed, the CTD said.

The suicide blast killed at least four people including three Chinese teachers who were working for the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi. The blast was carried out by a female suicide bomber of a banned terror organisation.

"The Chinese companies working in Pakistan want the government to offer a 20-year tax holiday in special economic zones to make Pakistan an attractive destination for foreign direct investment.

鈥淚 believe that the Pakistani government can consider the 20-year tax exemption policy for SEZs. Because in my opinion, only flexible policies can form certain advantages and attract more investors to choose Pakistan instead of other potential countries,鈥?said Yang Jiandou, Chairman of All Pakistan Chinese Enterprise Association (APCEA), in an exclusive interview with Daily Times. 鈥淟ong-term care and support for investors is of utmost importance. Investors who come to invest in Pakistan will definitely encounter many problems, and most of them cannot be solved by themselves, so they need long-term care and support from the local government and partners,鈥?he said to a question as to what will be his top three recommendations to policymakers to make the environment conducive to attracting foreign direct investment in Pakistan.

鈥淚t is essentially valuable for the Chinese investors to have the support of the Pakistani government and local partners. It is necessary for the Chinese investors, to have the specific channels for addressing their concerns and have them resolved within a certain period of time. In this way, the investor feels cared for and well-supported. He will not only invest himself, but also introduce more investors and endorse the business sector of Pakistan. In this process, local investors and companies in Pakistan can grow and develop, and eventually evolve into regional or world-renowned enterprises,鈥?he further said.

鈥淎 good reputation 鈥?as far as I know, many investors place great importance on the credibility of the government and local private sector companies, rather than the benefits of the project itself,鈥?the APCEA Chairman said, narrating his another recommendation. 鈥淎 good reputation will increase the confidence of investors. There is a saying in China that 鈥榯rust is more precious than gold鈥? Maintaining a stable and good reputation is a long-term work, depending on a period of 10 to 30 years,鈥?he continued. 鈥淎s long as an investor comes to Pakistan for inspection, even if he does not invest in the end, he will create employment opportunities in Pakistan鈥檚 aviation, hospitality and service industries, and will naturally generate taxes,鈥?Mr Yang added.

To a question as to which sectors would you like to recommend for the Chinese investors to invest in SEZs in Pakistan, he replied, 鈥淭he advancements in energy and transportation/infrastructure sectors in the first phase of the CPEC have greatly paved way and laid a firm foundation for the development of SEZs, hence attracting many Chinese investors. Although, the current circumstances are somewhat complicated especially with the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, Pakistan has its own distinctive orientation and an advantage of human resources,鈥?he said. 鈥淎ccording to the assessment of APECA, an increasing number of Chinese industrialists and investors are seeking collaborations with the local industries to secure win-win situations. Their present priorities include; enhancing the trade/business facilitation between Pakistan and China in the field of business services and logistics industry, increasing Pakistan鈥檚 potential and physical industrial capabilities at the automotive industry and textile industry, as well as improving the digital capacity building in the information industry, etc,鈥?he further said. 鈥淚 believe that industrial cooperation will continue to expand, and will certainly be extended to other fields,鈥?he hoped.

To a question as to what role Chinese companies can play in producing skilled labour for win-win benefits both for Pakistan and Chinese investors, Mr Yang said, 鈥淚 think Pakistan has good resources of skilled labor. For example, the company that I work for, POWERCHINA, already has a huge amount of skilled Pakistani labor active in various projects across Middle East, and even some excellent technical personnel are providing support to our projects in Eastern Europe and Africa. However, it is worthy to mention that Pakistan lacks skilled labor in some of the emerging industries. To overcome these gaps, I think local training institutes and Chinese companies need to work together to meet the international standards.鈥?
鈥淐hinese vocational training institutions are seeking cooperation with Pakistani training institutions to enhance skilled labor ability; Huawei also has a 鈥淪eed for Future Program鈥?that continuously attracts Pakistani youth interested in the IT sector to enhance their skills. For this reason, many Chinese companies have launched several student aid programs. For example, the CRBC Hundred-Student Scholarship Program has funded 50 students to study in China so far; CPHGC has sponsored 30 students from Balochistan to go to China for training, of which 27 technicians participated in the construction of the Hub project. Some Chinese enterprises have also established local schools offering free technical training for the local youth. For example, Huaneng Sahiwal Power Plant has established a vocational and technical training school, which is free for the society to recruit students, and can produces 600-800 Pakistani youths every year with professional and technical training in Chinese, as well as welders, electricians, thermal power simulators and other professional and technical training,鈥?the APCEA Chairman said.

鈥淚 would like to acknowledge that the Pakistani government has already established mechanisms for Chinese companies and investors to put forward their concerns and many issues have been resolved.鈥?
鈥淚n addition, some companies have signed MOU with local colleges also. For example, Bank of China Karachi Branch signed a MOU with Confucius institute in Karachi to provide various types of internship positions for local students; Energy China Gezhouba Dasu Project Department signed a MOU with COMSATS University to cooperate in scientific research, and other fields to harness the talents of the youth and pursue the goals of high-quality development together. I believe that with the in-depth investment and long-term development of Chinese companies in Pakistan, this gap will be reduced. APCEA will also provide active support and guidance in this regard,鈥?he maintained.

On a question about political and security-related factors impacting Chinese investments in Pakistan, Mr Yang said, 鈥淚 think the political stability of a location plays an important role in securing the confidence of the investors. Even more so, the security conditions and safety is a matter of utmost concern for the Chinese investors. We are well-aware that Pakistan has been working with laudable determination to overcome the security issues and has made successful efforts in this regard. Pakistan and China have maintained their collaborations and their ironclad bond through all scenarios. We are positive that with the continuation of this spirit, all such factors can be eliminated.鈥?
About problems being faced by Chinese investors in Pakistan, Mr Yang said, 鈥淚 think there are some general issues. The consistency and continuity of relevant policies is a crucial issue. Well-regulated policies, especially those pertaining to taxation, increase the confidence of investors. Moreover, I would like to acknowledge that the Pakistani government has already established mechanisms for Chinese companies and investors to put forward their concerns and many issues have been resolved, consequently. However, some problems may take relatively longer to be addressed due to inter-departmental or intra-departmental issues that may arise. But, with the continued support of our Pakistani counterparts, such little hurdles can surely be omitted.鈥?
鈥淭he consistency and continuity of policies is a crucial issue. Well-regulated policies, especially those pertaining to taxation, increase the confidence of investors.鈥?
鈥淲hen we talk about industrial parks, aside the land and policies, the operation of an industrial park requires many auxiliary projects, all of which are of indispensable importance such as; electricity, gas, water, transportation, human resources, visas for the foreigners, etc. So issues might be encountered in these regards but they can certainly be considered and resolved in advance,鈥?Mr Yang said.

鈥淓stablished with the similar goals, Pakistan-China Business & Investment Forum (PCBIF), is our joint collaboration with Board of Investment (PMU-CPEC-ICDP). It has been endorsed by the government of Pakistan and China in a joint statement. One of the key aspects of this platform and its (soon-to-be launched) website is not only to guide and facilitate industrial/B2B endeavours but also address, and resolve, the difficulties and problems that Chinese enterprises face while operating businesses in Pakistan,鈥?Mr Yang added.

The APCEA is an influential organization with more than 200 member Chinese enterprises and organizations based in Pakistan. It strives to enhance the economic and social cooperation between the member and local enterprises/ organizations 鈥?thus elevating China-Pakistan diplomatic ties. It has successfully established an avenue that facilitates mutual business ventures as well as economic and social connectivity. Currently, APCEA has three branches operating in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi. Its member enterprises sustain projects all across Pakistan in various sectors ranging from energy, aviation, infrastructure, textile, and telecommunication to industrial manufacturing, mining, and minerals."
"Fresh from their Asia Cup debacle, Pakistan now face the number two-ranked England at home for the first time in 17 years.

The marathon seven-match series comes less than a month away from the T20 World Cup in Australia, and even though the squad for the big tourney has already been named, changes are always possible, especially in the capricious world of Pakistan cricket.

Ahead of the series鈥?first match, here are five Pakistan stars who are under the media spotlight due to various reasons, and could use some eye-catching displays to ease things.

1- Babar Azam

Babar Azam plays a shot during the ICC men鈥檚 Twenty20 World Cup cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on October 24, 2021. 鈥?AFP/File

If Babar Azam could, he would roll the Asia Cup in a carpet, tie it to a cinder block and throw it into the ocean with a prayer that it makes it to the bottom. He鈥檇 be fine with never seeing or hearing from the tournament again, such was his torrid form in the tournament.

For a man who averages 42.36 in a single T20I, he couldn鈥檛 get past the 30 mark in any of his six outings.

All he managed were a paltry 68 runs for a tournament average of 11.33 runs. Had it been any other cricketer (barring Mohammad Rizwan), Babar would have been watching the England series from the comfort of his drawing room and with a remote control instead of a bat in his hands.

But the man we鈥檙e talking about here is Babar Azam. The accumulated goodwill from years of unerring run making means Babar the batter gets a pass. Babar the captain, though, doesn鈥檛 have that luxury, especially when the dominating narrative is that it was his captaincy that lost Pakistan the Asia Cup final.

A week or so removed from that horror show, Babar gets a swift chance to erase those painful memories with some glittering cover drives and some 60s and 70s 鈥?even if they come at a strike rate of let鈥檚 say 115.

Even if he fails again (God forbid), the powers that be are unlikely to swap him for a new captain so close to the World Cup, but it would definitely add to the accumulated damage that can be cited for mass changes post-World Cup that almost always happen.

2- Mohammad Rizwan

Mohammad Rizwan plays a shot during the semi-final of the World T20, 2021 against Australia on Nov 2021, at Dubai cricket stadium. 鈥?Picture courtesy: EspnCricinfo

It鈥檚 a strange world we live in where a man who was the highest scorer in the previous tournament is also under pressure and will have to prove his game. That鈥檚 how technical modern cricket has become.

While Babar鈥檚 problem during Asia Cup was him being unable to stay at the crease for long, Rizwan鈥檚 problem was completely the opposite. He was found guilty of hanging around for far longer than needed, which flipped the script on him.

His career strike rate of 127.07 is even lower than Babar鈥檚 but during Asia Cup it dipped 10 more to 117ish.

The pint-sized keeper now faces a fight to prove that he can score and score quickly. Again, like with Babar, Rizwan鈥檚 accumulated goodwill means his place in the T20 side is unlikely to come under threat any time soon, even more so because of a lack of options below him.

However, in the crazy world of Pakistan cricket, where narratives can prove decisive, if he fails to cover the sole chink in his armour, he could lose his spots in the other two formats where he is not seen as indispensible.

3- Iftikhar Ahmed

A file photo of Iftikhar Ahmed during a match. 鈥?Via Twitter

Forget form and strike rate, and let鈥檚 just admit that some of the critics鈥?problem with Iftikhar Ahmed is not cricket-related.

His nickname of 鈥淐hacha鈥?(uncle) should explain what the fans think of this 鈥?2-year-old鈥?

While Babar, Rizwan and some others have an impressive body of work crafted and chiseled over years to lean on in their times of crisis today, Iftikhar does not have that luxury.

The only thing he has perfected is his reputation of a jack-of-all, master-of-none type player who is supposedly a finisher but can鈥檛 even do that.

History tells us that those kind of team members who do not have a defined role and are not exactly crowd favourites can be the first line of defence in the face of criticism. The selectors wouldn鈥檛 think twice in replacing him from the World Cup squad even though he has made the original list, which remains editable.

Thus, Iftikhar would need a big England series and could desperately use a game or two where he finishes the game 鈥?or his game would be finished.

4- Khushdil Shah

Whatever you can say about Iftikhar, you can also say about Khushdil 鈥?minus the age jibe.

Khushdil is another one of those supposedly hard-hitting batters of similar ilk packed in the middle order. He is a domestic circuit stalwart who has failed to come up with the goods at this level so far.

His role can understandably be difficult at times 鈥?especially when the openers up top often end up batting in the meaningful part of the innings and only leave garbage overs behind. That said, after 19 T20Is, some of them against minnows, Khushdil should have something better to show than a strike rate of 110.31, average of 20.50 and a highest of 36, which he scored against Zimbabwe in Rawalpindi. That explains it all.

After the Asia Cup, it was thought that he was in the team on borrowed time but the not-so-nifty lefty still somehow made the cut for the World Cup. However, during the England series, every move of his will be scrutinized by cricketer-turned-cut-throat critics on TV.

He puts a foot wrong and off he鈥檇 be from the World Cup squad.

5- Usman Qadir

This file photo shows Usman Qadir. 鈥?AFP/File

Due to no real fault of his own, Usman Qadir could also be in the firing line and potentially cut from the World Cup squad, if someone else turns heads in the England series and he doesn鈥檛.

Some still consider Qadir to be the best legspinner in the country but he rarely gets meaningful opportunities due to Shadab Khan鈥檚 bowling resurgence and his ability with the bat developed over the past two years in PSL.

Qadir鈥檚 experience of domestic leagues in Australia means that ideally he should be on the flight Down Under.

However, if someone such as Abrar Ahmed 鈥?another leggie 鈥?were to play out of their skins in the England series and then had to be picked for the World Cup, Qadir could be the easiest sacrifice to offer as few would care or critique the move."
"KARACHI: The Chinese faculty members of the Confucius institute at University of Karachi handed over more than Rs0.6 million to Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi on Tuesday for relief of flood victims.

The Chinese faculty expressed that they want to provide some help to the people affected by the floods in Pakistan.

In their message, they mentioned that many parts of the country had witnessed massive floods after record-breaking rainfall leaving people to receive immediate help as the Chinese faculty realizes how important it is to come forward at this point of time.

KU VC Khalid Iraqi, who visited the CIUK, acknowledged the good gesture of the Chinese faculty members and expressed gratitude to the former Chinese Director of the CIUK Prof Zhang Xiaoping, who joined the meeting from China.

The KU VC mentioned that Pak-China has an iconic friendship and they are like brothers to each other.

He appreciated that the Chinese faculty for being committed to the task and busy teaching students as well as participating in flood relief activities.

Meanwhile, in the meeting KU VC Prof Dr Khalid Iraqi also discussed the future planning of the CIUK with its Pakistani and Chinese directors.

KU VC Prof Dr Khalid Iraqi advised the CIUK Pakistani Director Prof Dr Nasiruddin Khan to write a letter to the KU Syndicate to request the allocation of land for the CIUK."
"A Chinese national was shot dead and two others were injured on Wednesday afternoon after an unidentified assailant opened fire inside a dental clinic in Karachi鈥檚 Saddar area, a police official said.

Speaking at the scene of the crime, SSP South Asad Raza told reporters that one person was killed and two people were injured who were shifted to a hospital for treatment. He confirmed that the three were Chinese people.

He told Dawn.com that at around 4:05pm, an unidentified person posing as a patient came to the private dental clinic of Dr Richard Hu near Preedy Street and sat in the waiting area for tooth treatment.

鈥淎fter about 15 to 20 minutes, he entered the clinic area and opened fire on Dr Richard Hu, his wife Mrs Phen Teyin and Ronald Raymond Chou with a 9mm pistol,鈥?he said.

鈥淭he assailant was wearing a red cap and was clad in dark blue trousers and shirt,鈥?Raza elaborated, continuing that the suspect managed to escape from the crime scene with help of his accomplice who had parked his motorbike around the corner of Preedy Street towards M.A. Jinnah Road.

As a result of the firing, Dr Richard and Phen Teyin sustained bullet injuries, while Ronald, who was their employee, passed away on the spot.

鈥淩eportedly, Dr Richard H is running a private clinic in this area of Karachi for more than 40 years and the three victims held dual nationality of China and Pakistan,鈥?the official added.

Raza said that the police responded to the emergency in time and cordoned the area for the collection of evidence. 鈥淭he CCTV of the clinic and nearby shops have been obtained and is being processed for identification of the assailant.鈥?
Geo-fencing of the area was also undertaken to obtain important clues about the incident, he said. The investigation of the incident will be carried out by the Counter-Terrorism Department.

鈥淎t this stage, the motive of the incident remains unclear whether the victims were targeted owing to personal reasons or it was a terrorist attack,鈥?opined SSP Raza, adding that further investigation was underway.

Meanwhile, CTD DIG Asif Aijaz Shaikh told Dawn.com that nothing conclusive about the possible motive could be said at the moment.

He said that a team of CTD investigators was at the spot and probing the incident, adding that the findings would be shared with the media later.

Another CTD official, Raja Umer Khattab, said that the incident appeared to be a targeted killing carried out after a proper reconnaissance.

鈥淢ostly Chinese [people] who came on a visa and are affiliated with projects have been targeted in the past. But the Chinese dentist has been living in the country for the last 50 years and has become a Pakistani now,鈥?he said.

They were attacked as they were an 鈥渆asy鈥?target, Khattab added.

Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that at around 4:38pm, Ronald Raymond Chou, 32, was brought dead to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi. He had suffered two fatal bullet injuries on his neck and back.

Dr Syed said that two others 鈥?a man and a woman 鈥?were taken to the Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre in an injured state.

The police surgeon said the condition of both the injured foreigners was critical as they had suffered bullet wounds in their abdomen.

Both were provided initial treatment at Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre and after completion of medicolegal formalities, she said, adding that they were later shifted to the Aga Khan University Hospital for further treatment.

Asif, a neighbour of the Chinese couple who also owns a clinic in the area, said that the injured couple had children who live abroad, while Dr Hu鈥檚 brother, who is also a dentist, runs a clinic in another area of the city.

Meanwhile, the deceased man working as a 鈥渃ashier-receptionist鈥?was also a relative of the couple, he said.

Asif added he saw that the assailant wore a 鈥榬ed cap鈥?and fled on a parked motorbike. At the time of the incident, around 12-15 persons including staff were present inside the clinic, he said.

Condemnations

Taking notice of the incident, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the chief secretary of Sindh to prepare a report on the firing and immediately arrest the perpetrators.

In a tweet, he condemned the incident and expressed sorrow over the death of the Chinese citizen. 鈥淪uch incidents are intolerable. The security of Chinese residents should be ensured in every way,鈥?Sanaullah added.

Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also condemned the attack and expressed regret over the death.

He ordered that the investigation be completed immediately and the culprits brought to justice. 鈥淪uch cowardly and intolerable attacks cannot create cracks in Pakistan-China friendship, which is higher than the Himalayas and deeper than the seas,鈥?Bilawal said.

Earlier, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also took notice of the killing, according to a spokesperson.

The CM sought a detailed report from the Karachi Additional IGP. Shah also ordered the immediate arrest of the attackers and observed that such incidents were not tolerable, according to the official statement.

This incident is the latest in the recent spate of attacks on Chinese nationals in the country. In April, three Chinese nationals were killed in a suicide attack outside the University of Karachi鈥檚 (KU) Confucius institute.

A year earlier, a suicide bomb attack at a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese ambassador in Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan, killed four and wounded dozens. The ambassador was unhurt.

In July last year, a bus carrying engineers to a construction site near a dam in northwestern Pakistan was hit by a bomb, killing 13 people including nine Chinese workers."

"KARACHI: A Chinese national was killed while two others sustained injuries after an unidentified man attacked them inside a clinic in Saddar area of Karachi while posing as a patient, ARY NEWS reported.

"Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon revealed on Friday that the law enforcement authorities have captured the prime suspect behind the terrorist attack and subsequent killing of a Chinese dentist in Karachi.

On September 28, a Chinese dentist was killed and two others were injured after an unknown attacker opened fire on a clinic in Karachi鈥檚 Saddar area. The deceased was identified as 32-year-old Dr Donald Raymound Chou.

According to the minister, the suspect, identified as Waqar Khushk, has admitted to carrying out the crime and further investigations are underway.

One Chinese national killed, two injured in shooting in Karachi鈥檚 Saddar area

Addressing a press conference, Memon said that the terrorist was captured after the police received a tip pinpointing his location. He added that a raid was also conducted for the arrest and the suspect was identified with the help of CCTV footage and latest technology.

Memon noted that the suspect had no personal enmity with the victims and he carried the attack to provoke unrest in the country.

The suspect belonged to the banned Sindh Revolutionary Army, he said adding that the police also recovered a motorcycle from the terrorist.

In the shooting at the dentist鈥檚 clinic two weeks ago, two other Chinese nationals identified as 45-year-old Richard Chou and 40-year-old Margaret Hu were injured.

Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a detailed report of the incident from the Karachi Additional IGP.

The chief minister ordered the immediate arrest of the perpetrators and said that such 鈥渋ncidents are unacceptable.鈥?
Earlier this year, three Chinese nationals were killed when an explosion ripped through a van near the Confucius institute, located on the premises of the University of Karachi.

The Chinese nationals hit in the blast were members of the institute鈥檚 faculty. The deceased were identified as the director of the Confucius institute, Huang Guiping, Ding Mupeng, Chen Sai, and their Pakistani driver, Khalid."
"For decades, the Baloch insurgency has been termed as a low-intensity conflict confined mostly to Balochistan, the country鈥檚 largest province by territory. But that seems to have changed, as a spate of attacks that have taken place this year demonstrate that insurgency has entered a crucial new phase. Despite an intensive crackdown on rebels, the insurgency鈥檚 lethality has increased manifolds in recent times. As a result, more ferocious attacks, such as suicide bombings, high-profile targeted attacks, and high-profile kidnappings are now shaping the course of Pakistan鈥檚 oldest separatist insurgency. Especially since the start of this year, a remarkable shift in the strategy of Baloch militants has been evident. This year started with a large-scale attack in January on a security checkpoint in Balochistan鈥檚 Kech region that borders Iran. Less than a week later, another attack was carried out by the militants from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) suicide wing (the Majeed Brigade). In these attacks, militants stormed two security camps in Balochistan鈥檚 Nushki and Panjgur districts. Most of the time, figures of opponent casualties provided by the military and militants are difficult to independently verify. But the latest string of organized attacks has undoubtedly rocked not only Balochistan but the whole country. In addition to carrying out these attacks, Baloch insurgents are also using more modern weaponry than Pakistani security forces.

In April, the BLA鈥檚 first female suicide bomber, Shari Baloch, a research scholar and school teacher, attacked China鈥檚 Confucius institute in the southern port city of Karachi, killing four, including three Chinese nationals. This was a dramatic shift in the strategy as it aimed to expand the Baloch conflict to Pakistan鈥檚 major urban centres. Also following this strategy Baloch Nationalist Army (BNA) carried out a bomb blast in a busy Lahore business district, killing three persons and injuring over 20. Another new tactic was seen in mid-July when a Pakistani army Lieutenant Colonel was kidnapped by the BLA鈥檚 Special Tactical Operations Squad while on a holiday trip in the hill station of Ziarat in Balochistan. After this, the Pakistani army launched a rescue operation to rescue their senior officer.

Balochistan requires a political solution that can only be achieved through talks.

Shockingly, an unprecedented claim in the first week of August was made by the spokesperson of Baluch Raaji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), an umbrella group of four separatist Baluch groups. Claiming to shoot down a Pakistani military chopper in Balochistan鈥檚 Lasbela district. Pakistan Army media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) quickly rejected this claim and termed it false propaganda.

Again, in September, a helicopter belonging to Pakistan Army Aviation Corps crashed near Balochistan鈥檚 Harnai district. Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that its cadres had shot down the helicopter while it was on a rescue mission. The Army confirmed the downing of the chopper but didn鈥檛 give any specific reason for the crash. The claims of the Baloch militants can鈥檛 be verified, but there is a high possibility that they now possess some form of anti-aircraft capabilities.

After the US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, large quantities of highly sophisticated weapons, which were used by Afghan security forces, have made their way to the region鈥檚 black markets. Many of these US-made weapons have ended up in the hands of Baloch armed groups as well, like- M16A2 and M16A4 assault rifles, Trijicon ACOG optics, and M203 under-barrel grenade launchers. In addition to small firearms and RPG-7 pattern rocket launchers, Baloch insurgents are using various machine guns like PK(M) and MG3 variants. Sometimes insurgents have also been spotted using heavy machine guns (HMG). Baloch armed groups have gradually moved towards consolidation of what was previously a fragmented insurgency. Over the last few years, insurgent groups have either merged or formed tactical alliances to put up a united fight. By doing this, they were able to have a better pool of resources and better coordination to carry out complex operations. Also, the leadership of the armed groups has shifted from Tribal chiefs to the well-educated and highly motivated Baloch middle class. And these new ranks of Baloch insurgents are transforming the insurgency into guerrilla warfare.

It鈥檚 a hard truth that with time, the Baloch insurgents have adopted fighting tactics very much similar to Tehreek-E-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Pakistan policymakers have to understand that Baloch armed conflict can鈥檛 just be dealt with by military means. Balochistan requires a political solution that can only be achieved through talks. If the Pakistani state is willing to talk and negotiate with the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), why can it not follow this approach with Baloch armed groups?

NAIROBI-The 2022 Chinese film festival opened in Kenya on Thursday with a view to boosting Sino-Africa cooperation and cultural exchanges. Ababu Namwamba, newly appointed Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Youth Affairs, Sports and Arts said in a speech read on his behalf by Michael Pundo, CEO of Kenya Cultural Center that the film festival is a platform for filmmakers from the two countries to exchange ideas and enhance the viewership of Chinese films by the Kenyan audience. 鈥淚t is also a concrete action to actively implement the cultural and people-to-people exchange program under the nine plans of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) that was held in 2021,鈥?Pundo said.

The film festival was jointly organized by the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, the Kenya Cultural Center, and the Chinese Confucius institute in Kenya. According to the organizers, 14 Chinese films, 12 of which have been translated into Swahili will be screened to local audiences over the next one month. Pundo revealed that the collaboration to host the Chinese film festival reinforces Kenya鈥檚 commitment to improving cultural and artistic exchanges in various forms and promoting outstanding cultural and artistic products. He said that Kenya and China have strong bilateral relations which are underpinned by strong pillars such as the cooperation and exchanges in the film industry. Pundo noted the continued partnership between Kenya and China in the film industry has seen Kenya become part of the Silk Road International League of Theaters.

Zhou Pingjian, Chinese Ambassador to Kenya said that the exhibition of Chinese films in Kenya as well as Kenyan films in China will promote the understanding and communication between the two peoples.

Zhou noted that the key to close relations between different countries is cordial collaboration between the people of the countries. 鈥淔riendship and goodwill between people provide an avenue for the growth of strong bilateral relations,鈥?he added."
"General Qamar Javed Bajwa is retiring as army chief in the next few days, and as his six-year tenure at the head of the military comes to a close, we look back at some of the major events that punctuated his time at the helm of the Pakistan Army.

His selection

It is widely believed that on November 26, 2016, then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif saw in General Qamar Javed Bajwa a military leader who would steer clear of politics and by virtue of that distance, restore some balance to the civil-military equation.

Historically, the civil-military balance of power in Pakistan has been tilted in the military establishment鈥檚 favour, and Nawaz, a three-time premier, has seen his share of discord and falling out 鈥?including a coup that led to his ouster in 1999 鈥?with the army leadership.

It was, then, plausible for him to pick someone he believed to be a proponent of the army not intruding into the civilian space as the successor to retired Gen Raheel Sharif.

Gen Bajwa, who was posted as the Inspector General for Training and Evaluation at the General Headquarters at the time, seemed to fit the bill.

And so, his selection as Pakistan鈥檚 16th army chief was finalised.

He took the armed force鈥檚 command on November 29 six years ago, superseding four other generals who were recommended for the top slot.

Retired general Raheel Sharif hands over baton of command to General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad

The day Gen Bajwa was named as the new army chief, there were two terror attacks 鈥?one among them at a Frontier Corps camp in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa鈥檚 Mohmand region.

The attacks were a prelude to what the new chief would be dealing with. The menace of terrorism, which had gripped the country for long and had transiently abated after multiple military operations, was rearing its head again.

To combat this fresh resurgence, the military launched Pakistan鈥檚 first countrywide operation against terrorism, Radd-ul-Fasaad, on February 17, 2017.

Radd-ul-Fasaad, which roughly translates to 鈥榚limination of discord鈥? was initiated to indiscriminately eliminate 鈥渞esidual/latent threat of terrorism鈥? consolidate gains made in other military operations and further ensure Pakistan鈥檚 border security, the military鈥檚 media affairs wing explained at the time of its launch.

The operation has been underway for over five years now, and Gen Bajwa has said it is ensuring the country鈥檚 transition from 鈥渦ncertainty to peace鈥?

One of the significant steps taken under Radd-ul-Fasaad is the fencing of the 2,600km-long Pak-Afghan border 鈥?a move that has since faced resistance by the Taliban regime that regained power in Kabul last year.

This 2017 file photo shows a view of the Pak-Afghan border fencing in the Kurram region.鈥?Photo by Ismail Khan

The fencing began in June 2017 in an effort to improve the security situation along the international boundary, and in January this year, then-interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed announced it was almost complete.

But around the same time, videos surfaced on social media, purportedly showing Taliban fighters dismantling a portion of the fence along the frontier, claiming it was erected inside the Afghan territory.

Separately, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid also issued a statement, disregarding the need for the fencing.

But, the Pakistan Army remains resolute to complete the task.

Nawaz out, Imran in

While the army continued action against terrorism, Nawaz had his own battles to fight.

In April 2016, just months before Gen Bajwa was named as army chief, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists made 11.5 million secret documents available to the public. The documents, called the Panama Papers, revealed links between Nawaz鈥檚 family and eight offshore companies.

By the time Gen Bajwa replaced retired Gen Raheel Sharif in the army chief鈥檚 role, Nawaz and his family were already facing investigations and court proceedings over corruption allegations linked to the Panama Papers revelations.

The long and winding saga eventually concluded with Nawaz鈥檚 disqualification from public office in November 2017 鈥?but not because the Supreme Court found him guilty of corruption.

It was revealed during the investigation in the Panama Papers case that Nawaz had failed to declare his income from a Dubai-based firm while serving as the prime minister. The apex court concluded it was enough grounds to declare he had not been 鈥渉onest and faithful鈥?鈥?a pre-requisite for the chief executive鈥檚 office under the Constitution.

For the third time, Nawaz鈥檚 tenure as prime minister ended prematurely on July 28, 2017.

The military鈥檚 involvement in his premature ouster in 1999 is no secret, with the takeover orchestrated by then-army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf. But this time around, there were no immediate, outright accusations against Gen Bajwa for his removal. There were a few murmurs though, about the establishment鈥檚 intervention. And the speculation was but natural.

Because, as a Dawn editorial says: 鈥淭he establishment has a long history of meddling in politics. It has directly ruled the country for three decades. Analysts have pointed out that when not ruling directly, it has pulled strings from behind the scenes to oust elected governments, propped up pressure groups, created divisions in parties to split their vote bank, financed opposition parties to destabilise elected set-ups, etc. in order to maintain its grip on political power.鈥?
This observation, coupled with visibly strained civil-military ties following 鈥楧awn leaks鈥?鈥?a story published in Dawn that reported the details of a high-level civil-military meeting discussing the issue of banned outfits operating in Pakistan 鈥?was enough grounds for whatever little speculation there was about the establishment鈥檚 role in Nawaz鈥檚 ouster.

An open and direct allegation by Nawaz came two years later, when he was residing in London.

In September 2020, the PML-N supremo vehemently criticised the military at a multiparty conference of opposition parties of the time and alleged that there was 鈥渁 state above the state in the country鈥?

In subsequent public addresses, he named Gen Bajwa and then-Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) director general Lt-Gen Faiz Hameed, accusing them of toppling his government, pressuring the judiciary, and installing PTI chief Imran Khan鈥檚 government in 2018 elections.

In his eyes, it seemed, Gen Bajwa was no more the agreeable army general who believed in the army limiting its functions to its constitutional role.

The military denied Nawaz鈥檚 allegations and, Imran, who had succeeded him as the premier, excoriated the PML-N supremo for his criticism of the establishment.

Imran, a cricketer-turned-politician, whose rise to power is widely believed to have come through the military鈥檚 benevolence, saw his predecessor鈥檚 criticism of Gen Bajwa as a bid to 鈥減ressure鈥?the establishment into removing a 鈥渄emocratic government鈥?

This was two years before the PTI and PML-N leaderships would change positions in accusing the military establishment following the ouster of a civilian government and defending it against those allegations.

But prior to that, there would be other 鈥榠nterventions鈥?

An intervention made twice

In November 2017, activists of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) 鈥?the political wing of late firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi鈥檚 Tehreek-i-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah Pakistan 鈥?blocked the Faizabad interchange that connects Rawalpindi and Islamabad through the Islamabad Expressway and Murree Road, both of which are two of the busiest roads in the twin cities.

The agitators were furious over an amendment to the Elections Act, 2017, under which they said a sworn oath affirming a politician鈥檚 belief in the finality of Prophethood (Khatm-i-Nabuwwat) was deliberately modified. They were demanding the resignation of then-law minister Zaid Hamid, who would eventually give in to their demand, but only after days of unrest.

Their blockade of the Faizabad interchange would go on for a total of 20 days. They only called off the protest when the government 鈥?after the intervention of the army, following a failed police operation 鈥?accepted several of their demands.

An agreement was signed between the two sides, with then-ISI chief Gen Faiz Hameed as the 鈥榞uarantor鈥?

The agreement credited the army chief and his representative team for their 鈥渟pecial efforts鈥?and read, 鈥淲e are thankful to him (Gen Bajwa) for saving the nation from a big catastrophe.鈥?

Following the accord, an infamous video clip of then-Punjab Rangers director general Azhar Naveed Hayat went viral on social media in which he was seen distributing cash envelopes among the protesters. Police officials present at the time told reporters that the protesters were given Rs1,000 in cash each so that they could return to their homes.

The military鈥檚 role as a mediator and guarantor between the government and TLP was largely seen as the army getting ahead of its constitutional role. The intervention sparked a controversy and the Islamabad High Court lashed out at the government, as well as the army, for the role assigned to the military 鈥渁s the mediator鈥?in the agreement.

The Supreme Court took also suo motu notice of the matter and in its judgment issued in 2019, it directed the government, law enforcers, intelligence agencies and the army鈥檚 media wing to operate within their mandate. The apex court also ordered the federal and provincial governments to monitor and prosecute those advocating hate, extremism and terrorism and initiate action against armed forces鈥?personnel found to have violated their oath.

Yet, the mediation was, purportedly, repeated around three years later when the TLP took to the streets again and stirred unrest in multiple cities, with plans to converge on Islamabad.

This time, they sought the release of their incarcerated leader, Saad Rizvi 鈥?who succeeded his father Khadim Rizvi as leader after his death 鈥?and the expulsion of France鈥檚 ambassador over the publication of offensive caricatures depicting the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) in a French satirical magazine.

In mere days, the protests turned deadly and the violent episode ended after the government and TLP came to the table for another round of talks.

The new agreement was facilitated by Mufti Munibur Rehman and some other religious leaders after a National Security Committee meeting, chaired by then-PM Imran and with General Bajwa in attendance, decided on a course of action to deal with the matter.

While there was no official confirmation of the extent of the military鈥檚 role in mediating the 2021 resolution, Saylani Welfare Trust Chairperson Maulana Bashir Farooqi, who was among the facilitators of the agreement, told the media at the time that the army chief was 鈥?,000 per cent in favour of bringing peace in the country鈥?and was absolutely clear that there shouldn鈥檛 be any use of force against the protesters.

鈥淚t is because of his blessings that everything got done,鈥?The Express Tribune quoted Farooqi as saying.

The army chief鈥檚 vision

More than two years after Gen Bajwa took charge as army chief, the nation was introduced to the 鈥楤ajwa doctrine鈥?

The existence of the doctrine was first mentioned by then-Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor in January 2018. Then, following a briefing by Gen Bajwa to a group of journalists and anchorpersons, it was indirectly revealed to the country as the 鈥楤ajwa doctrine鈥?in March.

Media reports said the doctrine envisioned better relations with neighbouring countries, a balance in dealing with world powers, eliminating violent extremism and de-weaponising and mainstreaming terrorists, to name a few of the areas it covered.

A Dawn editorial described it as 鈥渙stensibly a template for bringing peace and security to Pakistan and the region鈥? The doctrine, the editorial said, 鈥渄elivered a blueprint for addressing complex and ingrained governance and economic issues in the country鈥?

The 鈥榙octrine鈥?was criticised by some sections of civil society and the media, mainly for its disapproval of the 18th Amendment 鈥?a legislation that lends greater autonomy to provinces.

The army, however, dismissed media conjecture on the doctrine and emphasised that it was, in fact, only a concept around security and had nothing to do with the country鈥檚 political and constitutional matters.

In 2021, Gen Bajwa expanded upon his vision for the country.

During an address at the Islamabad Security Dialogue in March that year, he stressed the importance of a shift from geopolitics to geoeconomics 鈥?a concept that was dubbed the 鈥楤ajwa doctrine 2.0鈥?by some sections of the Indian media.

In his speech, Gen Bajwa emphasised the need for boosting intra-regional trade and connectivity and bringing sustainable development through the establishment of investment and economic hubs. He also called for moving towards lasting and enduring peace within and outside and the non-interference of any kind in the affairs of Pakistan鈥檚 neighbours and regional countries.

鈥淲e have realised that unless our own house is in order, nothing could be expected from the outside,鈥?he had said on the occasion.

In line with this vision, then-foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was more direct in his choice of words when a week after Gen Bajwa鈥檚 speech he said Pakistan had shifted its priorities from geopolitics to geo-economics.

鈥淥ur new economic security paradigm has three essential pillars: peace, development partnerships and connectivity,鈥?he declared.

A more concrete step in this direction was the introduction of Pakistan鈥檚 first-ever national security policy in January this year. The policy acknowledged economic stability as a key component of national security, and the military resolved to play its 鈥渄ue part in achieving the vision laid out in the policy鈥?

Hybrid warfare

In 2018, Gen Bajwa identified a new challenge Pakistan was facing 鈥?hybrid warfare, also called fifth-generation warfare.

In a speech at a passing-out parade of cadets in April that year, the army chief told his audience that a 鈥渉ybrid war鈥?had been imposed on Pakistan. The purpose of the said war, he elaborated, was to internally weaken the country as enemies were failing to divide the country on the basis of ethnicity and other identities.

鈥淥ur enemies know that they cannot beat us fair and square and have thus subjected us to a cruel, evil and protracted hybrid war. They are trying to weaken our resolve by weakening us from within,鈥?he said.

It was for the second time that Gen Bajwa addressed the idea in an apparent reference to the then newly launched Pashtun Tahafuz Movement 鈥?a campaign for the rights of the Pakhtun people.

An opinion piece in Dawn later mentioned that the existence of a hybrid war was also cited in a review petition as grounds for the extension Gen Bajwa鈥檚 tenure.

The threat, it seemed, was looming large by mid-2020, when the army chief stressed at a Corps Commanders鈥?Conference the importance of protecting Pakistan from 鈥渇ifth-generation warfare and hybrid application by anti-Pakistan elements against Pakistan鈥檚 vital interests鈥?

Eventually, India was named as the main perpetrator of the offensive.

ISPR chief Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar told Global Village Space in December 2020 that India was engaged in a massive campaign of fifth-generation warfare to obstruct Pakistan鈥檚 road to prosperity mainly through targeting the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Pakistan鈥檚 international image.

鈥淯nfortunately, it鈥檚 a major onslaught, it鈥檚 a major part of the fifth-generation warfare. Pakistan is being subjected to [鈥 hybrid applications in a massive way and we are aware of that,鈥?he said.

The warning was reiterated by others in the government, including President Arif Alvi who said around a month before the Taliban takeover of Kabul that India was 鈥渟upporting militancy and terrorism鈥?in Afghanistan and using its soil for hybrid warfare in Pakistan.

From Muzaffarabad to Mian Channu 鈥?airspace violations by India

Debris of Indian aircraft shot down by the Pakistan Air Force in Azad Jammu and Kashmir on February 27, 2019. 鈥?Photo by ISPR/File

The Indian threat appeared on Pakistan鈥檚 horizon, quite literally, in February 2019.

On February 14, explosives packed inside a van ripped through buses in a convoy of 78 vehicles carrying some 2,500 members of the Indian paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force in India-occupied Kashmir鈥檚 Pulwama.

The blast claimed the lives of 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers, and banned outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility. But, India claimed Pakistan鈥檚 involvement.

Indian PM Narendra Modi vowed a 鈥渟trong response鈥?while Pakistan condemned the attack and demanded 鈥渁ctionable evidence鈥?of the allegations from across the border.

For his part, Gen Bajwa was clear that defending the motherland was the most sacred act and the army was ready to perform its duty to safeguard the country鈥檚 boundaries.

In the following days, an escalation in tensions was witnessed along India-Pakistan frontiers, as well as in diplomatic domains, amid calls for restraint.

The conflict reached its climax on February 26 when Indian military planes violated the Line of Control (LoC) 鈥?the boundary separating Azad Kashmir and India-occupied Kashmir 鈥?intruding from the Muzaffarabad sector.

鈥淧akistan Air Force immediately scrambled鈥?and Indian aircraft went back, the Pakistan Army鈥檚 media affairs wing said in a statement right after the incident.

Sharing a more detailed account of the episode, then-ISPR chief Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor held a press conference that evening and debunked the Indian claim of having 鈥渟truck the biggest training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Balakot鈥?during the incursion.

Now, he said, 鈥?it is time for India to wait for our response鈥?

The response came the next day when the Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) from Pakistani airspace.

鈥淚n response to PAF strikes [鈥 the Indian Air Force crossed the LoC. PAF shot down two Indian aircraft inside Pakistani airspace. One of the aircraft fell inside Azad Jammu and Kashmir while the other fell inside IOK,鈥?the ISPR said.

An Indian pilot was also arrested after the skirmish but was later released by Pakistan as a goodwill gesture.

Another incident of airspace violation by India was reported in March this year.

A missile from India entered Pakistan and fell near Khanewal district鈥檚 Mian Channu in March 鈥?a violation that New Delhi later explained as a consequence of 鈥渁ccidental firing鈥?and sacked three officers it held responsible for it.

However, Pakistan rejected the explanation as 鈥渟implistic鈥?and demanded a joint probe into the incident.

The unfolding of Gen Bajwa鈥檚 extension

By mid-2019, the skirmish in February, coupled with India鈥檚 move to strip occupied Kashmir of its special autonomy, had fuelled tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi. Meanwhile, talks between the Afghan Taliban and US on ending a prolonged war in Pakistan鈥檚 neighbour to the northwest had reached a critical juncture.

It was against this backdrop that then-PM Imran, 鈥渋n view of the regional security environment鈥? deemed it plausible to give approval for extending Gen Bajwa鈥檚 tenure as the chief of army staff by three years. The nod by the PM came just three months before Gen Bajwa was set to retire on November 29, 2019.

The matter, however, took an unanticipated turn on November 26 when the Supreme Court (SC) suspended the notification by the government for Gen Bajwa鈥檚 extension and grilled the attorney general on how the whole matter was handled.

Following two days of lengthy court proceedings and back-to-back cabinet meetings 鈥?all in an attempt by the government to satisfy the top court on the legal grounds of the move 鈥?the SC announced on November 28 that Gen Bajwa would retain the top military position for another six months.

鈥淕eneral Qamar Javed Bajwa has been appointed as COAS under Article 243(4)(b) of the Constitution with effect from 28.11.2019,鈥?read the SC short order.

In the same order, the apex court shifted the onus to parliament when it asked the government to determine the tenure, terms and conditions of service of the army chief through legislation within six months, till the end of Gen Bajwa鈥檚 extension.

In January 2020, three bills pertaining to the tenure of the three services chiefs 鈥?chief of army staff, chief of air staff and chief of naval staff 鈥?and the chairman of the joint chief of staff committee were passed by the National Assembly. The legislations were passed within 20 minutes and a day later, the bills were bulldozed through the Senate, paving way for a three-year extension in Gen Bajwa鈥檚 term.

On the completion of his three-year extension on November 29 this year, Gen Bajwa will join retired Ashfaq Parvez Kayani as the longest-serving army chief in Pakistan under a civilian setup.

The 61-year-old general could have surpassed Gen Kayani in terms of the length of his tenure had he sought, and been granted, another extension before approaching 64 鈥?the retirement age for services chiefs.

However, he made it clear around a month before his retirement date that he would not be seeking another extension and bidding adieu to arms at the end of his term.

Yet, the speculation about his extension did not entirely die down as the government seemed set to amend the Pakis颅tan Army Act 1952, purportedly in a bid to prolong Gen Bajwa鈥檚 tenure until he installation of a new government and evade any controversy over the new chief鈥檚 appointment.

鈥楰arachi incident with Maryam Nawaz鈥?
Months after Gen Bajwa鈥檚 extension was finalised, the military establishment found itself caught up in a controversy, which ended with the removal of ISI and Rangers officials who were found to have acted 鈥渙verzealously鈥?during the weeks-long episode euphemistically referred to as the 鈥楰arachi incident鈥?

The incident took place in October 2020 鈥?at a time when Nawaz had become excessively critical of the military establishment and the Imran administration. In his speeches streamed at Pakistan Democratic Alliance鈥檚 (PDM) power shows, he would not shy away from naming the army chief as the man responsible for his ouster and blast the PTI government.

It was for one such PDM rally on October 18, 2020 that Nawaz鈥檚 daughter and PML-N vice-president Maryam Nawaz, along with husband Capt Mohammed Safdar, arrived in Karachi.

After attending the rally, when Capt Safdar and Maryam retired to their hotel room, security personnel visited their hotel and arrested Capt Safdar.

It was later reported that in the early hours of October 19, Rangers personnel, accompanied by some intelligence officials, had arrived at former Sindh inspector general of police Mushtaq Mahar鈥檚 residence and compelled him to accompany them to the local sector commander鈥檚 office. There, the province鈥檚 top cop was forced to sign arrest orders for Capt Safdar who was accused in a first information report of having violated the sanctity of the Quaid鈥檚 mausoleum the previous day by raising slogans at the mausoleum.

The incident had left the Sindh government, with PPP at the helm, redfaced. The provincial police, too, was incensed; at least 13 senior officials had applied for leave on the grounds that their high command had been 鈥渞idiculed鈥?and the entire force left 鈥渄emoralised and shocked鈥?

What appeared to be snowballing into a full-blown crisis was somewhat defused only when Gen Bajwa acceded to PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari鈥檚 request to hold an inquiry into the incident.

鈥淭hat Mr Bhutto-Zardari looked to Gen Bajwa to order an inquiry, and this was undertaken, also indicates that the perpetrators were taking instructions from individuals in the security establishment,鈥?highlighted a Dawn editorial.

Later, it turned out the FIR against Capt Safdar too was based on false information.

Eventually, ISI and Rangers officials involved in the incident were removed pending further departmental proceedings for having acted 鈥渙verzealously鈥?

ISI chief鈥檚 appointment 鈥?the first tear in the 鈥榮ame page鈥?

Until then, and for months ahead, the relationship between the Gen-Bajwa-led military establishment and the civilian government under Imran Khan remained congenial for the most part and assurances that both sides were on the 鈥渟ame page鈥?would come frequently.

The first signs of a tear in the page between the military and civilian leadership appeared in October 2021 when Imran and Gen Bajwa reportedly disagreed on the ISI chief鈥檚 appointment.

The army announced on October 6 that the former ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, had been made the Peshawar corps commander, while Lt Gen Anjum was appointed in his place.

But the Prime Minister鈥檚 Office (PMO) did not issue an official notification of Lt Gen Anjum鈥檚 appointment immediately, leading to rumours about strains in civil-military relations.

Multiple reasons were cited in the ensuing weeks for the then-PM not approving the appointment right away, including his desire to retain the incumbent spymaster for some time due to an uncertain situation in Afghanistan and his insistence on being allowed to exercise the authority to appoint the country鈥檚 new spymaster.

It was after nearly three weeks of a stand-off that Lt Gen Nadeem Ahmed Anjum was notified as the country鈥檚 spymaster on October 26.

LoC ceasefire

Meanwhile, echoes of the February 2019 skirmish and gunshots continued to ring in the Kashmir valley 鈥?the disputed region that has remained the main cause of contention between India and Pakistan.

In November 2003, the arch-rivals had agreed on ceasefire along the LoC, as well as the Working Boundary, which separates Pakistan鈥檚 Punjab and India-occupied Kashmir.

The agreement was held for a few years, but regular violations were occurring since 2008, and a sharp spike in breaches was witnessed since 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in India.

According to the ISPR, the deal had largely held till 2016, when tensions exploded in occupied Kashmir, resulting in a surge in violence between India and Pakistan.

As fighting along the LoC raged, ties between the rivals went into freefall with India repeatedly accusing Pakistan of sending infiltrators across the LoC and Islamabad lambasting PM Modi鈥檚 government for stoking Hindu nationalist sentiment against Muslims.

The firing along the LoC seemingly reached a climax in 2020, with thousands of clashes reported. But the damage from coronavirus and slowing economies 鈥?along with a geopolitical tug of war 鈥?appeared to have convinced both sides to halt as they agreed on February 25, 2021 to the strict observance of all agreements, understandings and ceasefire along the LoC.

The matter garnered attention again this year when then-Indian army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane claimed the ceasefire on the LoC continued to hold because New Delhi had negotiated from a position of strength.

Rebutting the claim, the Pakistan military termed it 鈥渃learly misleading鈥?

The ceasefire was agreed 鈥渙nly due to Pakistan鈥檚 concerns for the safety of people of Kashmir living on both sides of the LoC鈥? the ISPR DG tweeted. 鈥淣o side should misconstrue it as their strength or other鈥檚 weakness.鈥?
Army diplomacy 鈥?the China, US, Afghanistan nexus

Since 2008, there has been no coup. The PPP and PML-N governments preceding the PTI administration had managed to complete their parliamentary terms, even with the premature ouster of every prime minister during this period.

In these regimes, the military establishment would not openly meddle in politics and other affairs outside of their constitutional domain but continued to step in on important matters such as national security and foreign policy.

If anything, 鈥淕en Bajwa鈥檚 recent high-profile visits to Washington and other capitals testify to the establishment鈥檚 continuing predominance in the country鈥檚 power structure. The protocol was not what another country鈥檚 army chief would have received,鈥?noted analyst Zahid Hussain in a recent opinion piece for Dawn.

During Gen Bajwa鈥檚 tenure, the army鈥檚 role in this set-up gained prominence with respect to Afghanistan.

Pakistan was a key player in efforts to resolve the conflict between the Western-backed government and the Afghan Taliban during a two-decade-long war. The military establishment鈥檚 role in the area was evident with Gen Bajwa鈥檚 visits to the war-ravaged country, where he would not just hold discussions on bilateral interests but also extend support for the Afghan peace process.

And soon after the Taliban regained control in Afghanistan in August last year, then-ISI chief General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed flew to Kabul. An official agenda for his visit was not issued but Gen Hameed was in the Afghan capital supposedly to hold meetings with the new Taliban regime and discuss security and border management issues among other matters.

PTI鈥檚 Fawad Chaudhry, who was the information minister at the time, had explained the visit as a necessary unconventional contact amid a power vacuum in Afghanistan.

But since the ascent of the Afghan Taliban to power, there has been an increase in attacks by militants in Pakistan from across its northwestern frontier as Afghanistan continues to be the abode of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commanders.

While Pakistan has condemned the use of Afghan soil by militants, the Taliban government has accused Pakistani forces of carrying out strikes in Afghanistan and alleged that Islamabad allowed the US the use of a base to carry out a drone strike in Kabul that killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Pakistan, however, has expressly rejected the Taliban government鈥檚 claim about Pakistani airspace being used for the US strike that killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.

The Pakistan-Afghanistan nexus also takes into consideration US ties with the two south Asian countries, which in the case of Pakistan, were strained after Americans found and took out Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in 2011 without informing Islamabad.

Ten years later, when the US finally decided to wind up its war in Afghanistan, Washington blamed Pakistan for Kabul鈥檚 fall and accusing Islamabad of supporting the Afghan Taliban put another dent in the relationship.

Prior to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, reports by the American media said Washington continued to focus on Pakistan for a military base in the region, although some US officials believed the negotiations had reached an impasse.

鈥淪ome American officials (told the newspaper) that negotiations with Pakistan had reached an impasse for now. Others have said the option remains on the table and a deal is possible,鈥?a New York Times report said.

The report also mentioned that the Central Intelligence Agency director had met the ISI chief in Islamabad while the US defence secretary had had frequent calls with Gen Bajwa about getting Pakistan鈥檚 help for future US operations in Afghanistan.

Later, then-PM Imran ruled out allowing the US access to bases in Pakistan post-America鈥檚 pullout from Afghanistan, responding to a question about the possibility of the scenario during an interview with an 鈥渁bsolutely not鈥?

Despite this friction, the US continued to believe after its withdrawal from Afghanistan that Pakistan still had enough leverage on the Afghan Taliban to influence their policymaking and urged it to 鈥減ush the Taliban in the right direction鈥?

The US-Pakistan ties, which were further strained after former PM Imran accused Washington of a conspiracy to oust his government, however, have seen improvement since the installation of a new coalition dispensation in Islamabad.

It was at this juncture when the new set-up was struggling to put off a default risk and the International Monetary Fund鈥檚 (IMF) assistance became vital, that Gen Bajwa contacted US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, reportedly, to request help in securing an early disbursement of funds by the IMF.

The University of Oregon, San Francisco State University and Western Kentucky University have now joined the list of 12 other US higher education institutes who have closed the centers administered by the Chinese government due to increased scrutiny lately.

Despite the application of institutes to the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Department of Defense, for possible waivers to the law, it is assumed that the department denied all waivers.

The National Security Education Program aims to promote or endorse foreign languages along with facilitating cultural expertise.

鈥淚t has helped us campus-wide to foster mutual understanding, constructive dialogue and evidence-based comprehension of China, its global emergence, its culture and its people. We would have very much preferred to retain both programs,鈥?Galvan added.

"China believes in dialogue to resolve mutual difference but is ready to fight to the end if any attempts are made to push it to the wall vis-脿-vis ongoing trade war with the US, said Chinese Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Lijian Zhao in his address at an Iftar dinner hosted at the embassy premises.

鈥淔irst, there has been no change of position as far as China is concerned. China addresses differences through dialogue and consultation, because this is in the interests of not only China and the US but also the international community. In the face of the US threats to raise tariffs, China still sent a high-level delegation to the US for talks as agreed, out of consideration for the bigger picture and showing sincerity and goodwill,鈥?he said in his address. 鈥淏ut, at the same time, China takes a firm stance on safeguarding its legitimate interests. As differences emerge in any negotiations, twists and turns are inevitable. But, the two sides should respect each other, treat each other as equals and strive for a mutually beneficial deal,鈥?he maintained.

鈥淐hina does not want a trade war but it is not afraid of one and will fight one if necessary. If the US is willing to negotiate, the doors for negotiations are open. If US will resort to unfair pressure, China will fight to the end. The recent announcement on countermeasures is proof that China is fully prepared,鈥?Zhao asserted. 鈥淲hat a responsible big country should do is to stop thinking about 鈥楢merica First鈥?at the expense of others,鈥?he added.

鈥淪ecretary Pompeo who has been trying to mislead the public by willful lies is now attempting to incite an ideological conflict. This is totally illogical. Ideological differences do not necessarily obstruct economic, trade, industrial, technological cooperation. US government, either Democrats or Republicans, has been all along working with CPC-led Chinese government in advancing, expanding and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, which has brought tangible benefits to business sector and consumers,鈥?Zhao said.

Regarding Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan鈥檚 visit to Pakistan, Zhao said it remained very successful. 鈥淒uring the visit, he met with president and prime minister. His visit was meant to send a strong message to the international community that China-Pakistan relationship is an exceptional one,鈥?he said.

The project will have the capacity to supply 2000 MW with 10 percent overloaded capability for two hours,鈥?he revealed.

鈥淭he other project is Rashakai Special Economic Zone (RSEZ) which will promote industrialisation through optimally priced, world-class industrial infrastructure in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The RSEZ is situated centrally in the CPEC at the junction of Karakoram Corridor and ML-1 development corridor. It is set to become, and will be designed, to be the key trade and logistics hub connecting Kashgar, Kabul and Gwadar on the Belt and Road, and be a high-end host of international commercial, technological and manufacturing hub,鈥?he continued.

鈥淭he two countries also inaugurated the Confucius institute at the University of Punjab in Lahore. The institute mainly provides Chinese education, cultural promotion and cultural exchanges and other projects and activities,鈥?he went on to add. 鈥淗uawei Technical Support Center to be established in Pakistan as part of Chinese tech giant鈥檚 commitment to make massive investment in Pakistan was also launched during the visit,鈥?he added.

"ISLAMABAD: Parliamentarians, members of civil society and women鈥檚 rights activists all vehemently urged political parties to ensure effective implementation of 5 percent quota in awarding party tickets to women on general seats in the upcoming general election 2018, in accordance with Elections Act 2017.

They were speaking at the publication launch of Making Gender Quota Meaningful, organised and published by Heinrich Boell Stiftung (HBS) on Wednesday. The authors Rukhshanda Naz and Hassan Nasir Mirbahar, detailed the historical context of gender quota as well as the legal framework for women鈥檚 political participation and highlighted potential issues and solutions.

According to the report, while women鈥檚 representation in Pakistan鈥檚 federal parliament has significantly increased in the past two decades, due to lack of implementation of the quota, the its full potential is yet to be realised. Compared to only 1.8 percent of members in 1995, women accounted for an aggregate of 20.7 percent of the total membership of National Assembly and the Senate in 2015.

Speaking on the occasion, HBS Country Director Jacqueline Wilk commented on the need for including diverse profiles and perspectives on the gender quota and that gender democracy is a core component of HBS. She further acknowledged that women鈥檚 increased representation in Parliament was a global issue, as even in Germany, only 34 percent is women representation.

The European Union Mission for Election Observation & Monitoring was also presented at the launch and noted the importance of accountability for free and fair elections.

Moderating the event, gender rights activist and academic Dr Farzana Bari acknowledged that lack of gender representation is not only a Pakistan-specific issue but a global one sharing that only 23 percent women are in the World Parliament.

The event saw balanced representation from almost all parties such as Nargis Nasir and Nusrat Sehr Abbasi from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), Shazia Ahmed from the National Party (NP), Anisa Zeb from the Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) and Ismat Shahjahan from the Awami Workers Party (AWP).

Shazia Ahmed representing NP spoke about the importance of utilising the gender quota effectively so in future elections, the country can move past just quotas and have organic equal political participation and representation.

Ismat Shahjahan from AWP commented on the flawed nature of mainstream politics which the quota is impacted by as well.

鈥淲hile we are appreciative of the affirmative action quota, our party before the Elections Act 2017 had planned to give seats to youth and women. Our party believes in the feminist agenda,鈥?she expounded.

Nargis Nasir from PML-N, implored foundations and non-governmental organisations to invest in the training of female politicians and candidates so they can be quality leaders in their communities. She also criticised rampant nepotism that takes place with some prominent female candidates where their male relatives are the ultimate decision-makers.

Anisa Zeb from QWP noted that her party focuses on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. She shared that she was a grassroots and middle class candidate who is optimistic to running on the quota as it has made her entry easier.

Representing NP, Ahmed pointed out that Rs 30,000 is not possible for many individuals who wish to stand and that women campaigners often don鈥檛 have the same access to campaign funds and support as male counterparts or the same power in their area, so women are not able to run in their strongholds. She also noted that if class, religion and cultural representation is needed, then male leadership needs to accept not only women but individuals from all walks of life for greater inclusivity in government and society.

National Commission on the Status of Women Chairwoman Khawar Mumtaz offered the closing remarks and stressed that women鈥檚 socio-economic progress in the country is intrinsically tied to their representation and clout in politics.

鈥淭his quota is a minimum legal requirement. It took 10 years of sustained work for this quota to be established and was by and large, the result of women鈥檚 hard work. The previous government could not reach quorum without women candidates so every election has been a milestone in furthering women in politics,鈥?Khawar Mumtaz.

She also remarked that women have potential power as candidates and voters, but that women will not come out and vote in great volumes unless they believe voting will improve their lives. The chairwoman stressed that political culture needs to be changed within parties and women should not be token candidates but achieve a critical mass.

"Understanding the game-changer

Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the multi-billion-dollar idea, has been making waves in across the globe since it鈥檚 launching by Chinese visionary President Xi Jinping back in 2013 with the aim to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes for common trade and shared benefits.

However, the world would never be able to understand the prodigy behind the move as every country and every organisation wants to see the initiative under their own biased and faulty prism. I was too confused to understand why and how the world can come out with so much divergent opinions over an economic initiative aiming at shared benefits for entire world.

However, I only could understand the acumen behind the move till I had an opportunity to visit China and meet with the Chinese scholars and officials of Communist Party of China (CPC) and hear from the vision behind the project right from the horses鈥?mouth.

Till date, 130 countries or international organisations have either signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) or have expressed interest in joining the BRI which an open-ended and inclusive initiative.

There are many opportunities under the BRI. CPEC, being the pilot project of BRI, is a test case for both Pakistan and China.

We know that Pakistan is a linchpin in the BRI. China has made $60 billion Foreign Direct Investment to the BRI countries out of which over 20 percent 鈥?$ 19 billion 鈥?has been invested only in Pakistan. Out of total 200,000 jobs created across the BRI countries, Pakistan has got the biggest share as 75,000 jobs were created only in Pakistan 鈥?thus making Pakistan the biggest destination overseas for Chinese investment.

One thing is clear that BRI is not a geopolitical or a military alliance and rather it is purely an economic initiative aimed at laying a network of connectivity for trade, economic and culture cooperation and exchanges.

He said China and Pakistan were enjoying deepened and time-tested relations that are more strengthened with China Pakistan Economic Corridor. Waodong Yang lauded the steps being taken on the part of the UAF for the ensuring the quality education, research and community services."
"The role of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has great significance for the region in terms of transportation infrastructure, energy, trade, commerce, industrial cooperation, agricultural cooperation, tourism, healthcare, personal contact, education, and much more. The value of CPEC projects is now worth 62 billion US dollars. Although various scholars have presented a lot of literature, the negative and positive aspects already elaborated upon; very few presented the alternative benefits of CPEC on Pakistani academia.

There are many ongoing projects that are relevant to the educational uplifting of Pakistan. The economic corridor between China and Pakistan will have a great impact on the culture of both countries, and academia should play a positive role by preparing the citizens of these two countries for the upcoming changes.

CPEC will also help Pakistan鈥檚 education sector 鈥?various training centres are established in Gwadar and plans are underway to open universities along the route to bring China and Pakistan closer to each other. This gives Pakistani students the opportunity to study in China and encourages more teachers to work in schools in that area, and also real estate builders to build them.

Under CPEC, the youth of Pakistan has been availing scholarship opportunities in China. The Confucius Foundation will open more courses to enrol Pakistani students in various disciplines in the near future, which will be a great source of scholarship for those with financial problems. In the coming days, people will get more opportunities provided by those familiar with Chinese technologies and values. It is believed that the youth will have a better chance of improving their education with the cooperation of Chinese government in this regard.

This gives Pakistani students the opportunity to study in China and encourages more teachers to work in schools in that area

Chinese envoy Sun Weidong, addressed a scholarship awarding ceremony in a local hotel in Islamabad. He said, under CPEC, 220 more students will get an admission in various disciplines of the top Chinese universities for the academic year. Students will be taught many disciplines, which will encourage them to secure admissions in Master, MPhil and PhD programmes in China.

Under this project, talented youth may be awarded an admission in technology, computer sciences, engineering, international relations, journalism, agricultural and natural sciences etc. The Ministry of Education in China supports Chinese universities in allocating special funds to all students coming from abroad including Pakistan.

It is worth mentioning here that there are total of 15,625 students enrolled in various universities of China out of them 2,700 students are being funded by the Chinese government鈥檚 scholarship programme and over a thousand students are enrolled on other scholarships given by the universities. Under a separate scholarship programme, Chinese universities are offering scholarships to the underprivileged youth of Pakistan as well.

There are some achievements in the education sector by Pakistan also; two new universities are scheduled to be setup in Balochistan under CPEC. There are a number of Pakistani youngsters who are already enrolled in China and 131 students have gotten scholarship opportunities through CPEC this year. By enrolling under CPEC, Pakistan will be known as the largest scholarship winning country by the Chinese government in South Asia following the Vision of 2025.

Few recommendations for CPEC as academia are mentioned here:

In the current project within the framework of CPEC, universities in Pakistan will provide a more hands-on experience to students and universities, to ensure the transfer of technology by strengthening connectivity within the industry. Higher education experts should be involved in achieving goals set for CPEC and the Vision of 2025.

The Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan is an autonomous body working on regulations of universities, it should take initiative to start a conversation with research centres and other organisations, incentivising their contacts with all companies to establish incubation facilities and grant access to various universities.

A comprehensive document will be prepared and submitted to the Planning Commission of Pakistan for the effective implementation of the various projects, and to determine the role of universities and researchers in achieving the goals of CPEC and the Vision of 2025.

The provision of Chinese language courses is another crucial element in achieving the success of CPEC. Universities in Pakistan can develop a strategy with a partnership with the Chinese embassy to establish more Chinese language centres as are already implemented by the Confucius institute at COMSATS Institute of Information Technology in Islamabad since 2013.

The other final but crucial aspect is the tremendous research opportunity that Pakistani universities will get to map the social, economic, environmental and political impacts of CPEC. If it does not bring any benefits to the local people, all this massive investment will eventually be lost. All policy makers and think tanks should be involved in producing more research for boosting this mega project. Universities in Pakistan must sign more MOUs with Chinese universities for an exchange programme. It is expected that youth of Pakistan will gain more momentum by getting scholarship and higher education under CPEC.

"ISLAMABAD: The National University of Modern Languages (NUML) has once again hiked its semester fee by almost Rs 4,000, adding additional charges.



Earlier, students at various faculties of the university were required to pay up to Rs40,000 as semester fee. However, that has jumped to Rs.43,900.



The varsity has added a charge of development fund worth Rs3,150 while the tuition fee stands at Rs20,060.



Previously, varsity officials said that before 2012, students were not required to pay the development fund.



Students, however, have objected that if the university is carrying various activities in different departments or expanding the infrastructure, why they - the students - should pay for that development.



Being a government run university, the educational organisation gets funds from the Higher Education Commission and then from various donors such as the Confucius institute 鈥?which was constructed by China 鈥?yet the university has been increasing the fee under the development charges, the student added while requesting not to be named.



Some officials allege the varsity has been raising the fee to meet its administrative expenses after having hired officials at senior posts on hefty packages at the campus and on its sub-campuses. The varsity has seven sub-campuses in various cities of the country but strength of students at these campuses is low.



The Supreme Court had in 2012 declared as unlawful the rehiring of retired officials or on deputations on higher pay scale and or on out-of-turn promotions in all government departments.



Meanwhile, while responding to the allegations, NUML鈥檚 Public Relations Officer Bilal Khan defended the increase in fees.



He maintained that the hike was in accordance with the rules since the government had allowed all universities to raise fees annually by 10 per cent.



鈥淭he varsity did not raise the fee for the last two years,鈥?he said, adding, 鈥渟o this year it increased the fee under various heads since prices of everything have increased with the passage of time.鈥?

"China鈥檚 Confucius institute is playing a major role in popularising Chinese language in Pakistan and promoting people to people contacts, sources said here on Friday.

According to the Institute鈥檚 sources, some of the educational institutions in Pakistan鈥檚 major cities are running well the Confucius institute and hoping more will be coming up in the next few months.

In countries including Pakistan, Cambodia, and Bangladesh have shown particular interest in blending language skills with future Belt and Road projects

Confucius institutes take Chinese language and culture to a global audience eager to learn more about the country

The opening lines of The Analects, one of China鈥檚 most famous historic texts, read: 鈥淚s it not a pleasure to study and practice what you learn? Is it not good when friends visit from far-off places?鈥?
More than 2,000 years after they were written, the aphorisms of its author 鈥?the Chinese sage Confucius 鈥?might well refer to China鈥檚 rising language centres.

In a mere 12 years, Confucius institutes have opened on 500 campuses and are now teaching Chinese language and culture to almost 2 million people.

Attached to foreign universities, the Confucius institutes 鈥?overseen by the Office of Chinese Language Council International, or Hanban 鈥?are a network of not-for-profit Mandarin language teaching schools and cultural centres for those who seek to learn about China.

The first institute opened its doors in Seoul in 2004. By the following year, there were 33 in operation. Today there are more than 500, spread across more than 134 countries and on every continent apart from Antarctica.

One of the reasons for the institutes鈥?current popularity, says Chu Hung-lam, director of Hong Kong鈥檚 own Confucius institute, is that China is genuinely interested in getting people to learn firsthand about its unique 鈥?often misunderstood 鈥?culture.

鈥淐hina wants to tell and show herself and be understood,鈥?explains Chu, who is also head of the Chinese culture department at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

As well as offering Chinese courses to the general public, the institute provides tailored language classes to a range of would-be Mandarin speakers, including undergraduates and university staff, businesspeople and government officials.

The Chinese economy is driving global interest in Mandarin, placing the Confucius institute network in an enviable position. Thanks to China鈥檚 economic clout and expanding diplomatic links with the 60-plus countries included in the Belt and Road Initiative, there is little work needed to promote the language.

Xu Tao, director of international cooperation and exchanges at the Ministry of Education, says: 鈥淲e help people in countries along the Belt and Road learn Chinese and these countries help us learn their languages.鈥?
However, the reality is that the majority of Confucius institutes are currently located in only a handful of countries. More than 100, for instance, are in the United States, and more than two dozen in the United Kingdom.

It is unlikely that China鈥檚 economic power, on its own, can maintain a deep, widespread interest in learning a second language, says Molly Huang, who teaches Mandarin in South China鈥檚 Guangdong province and Hong Kong. Instead, she says that first and foremost, language is entwined with culture."

To cater the immense interest of the students, some new language institutes have popped up to cash in on the opportunity, Daily has learnt on Thursday.

The religious schools or Madarsas have also taken initiatives to introduce Chinese language courses to their students. For instance, a traditional seminary, Madrasah Sattariya Karachi has started offering short-term Chinese language courses, where more than 200 students have been enrolled so far.

It is pertinent to mention that here that the Karachi University has been conducting a significant role in promoting the rich Far-Eastern language and cultural studies for the local students and had established the 鈥淐onfucius institute鈥?in 2011.

Consequently, around 2000 students have been enrolled in short courses on Chinese language at five institutes in Karachi including KU鈥檚 Confucius institute, Madrasah Sattariya Karachi, National University for Modern Languages (NUML), Preston University and DHA Central Library (DCL).

Chinese Language learning centers of the metropolis are also offering monthly courses for those, who are engaged in business activities with their counterparts in China, besides offering three- month and six-month diploma courses for the interested students, professional translators and interpreters.

These institutes are focusing on the current scenario in the country and have been providing a platform to learn Chinese language, as people are eyeing on the prospect of China-Pakistan relationship and the CPEC鈥檚 benefits. The skill in Chinese Language will be an added benefit for those, who are willing to work with the Chinese workers.

鈥淟anguage is a basic tool of communication, while people of both countries will come closer to each other, not only culturally but they will understand each other鈥? said Jawad Madani, Director of Madrasah Sattariya鈥檚 Chinese language institute, adding that Pak-Chinese entrepreneurship will be increasing in coming years and anyone with multi-lingual qualities can hope for a bright prospect.

鈥淐hinese will be the language of business community in the entire world, therefore KU had established the Confucius institute since 2011, and this year over 1100 students have enrolled in its two shifts to learn Chinese, while last year鈥檚 enrollment ratio was only 200鈥? said Prof. Moinuddin Siddiqui, Director of KU鈥檚 Confucius institute.

He said that over 480 Confucius institutes are functioning in 133 countries, while Pakistan has only three institutes, which are situated in Islamabad, Faisalabad and Karachi respectively.

鈥淚 am not so sure about my future, therefore I have decided to take an additional admission in Confucius institute for learning Chinese language, because there are many job opportunities for those students, who can speak, read and write Urdu Chinese and English鈥? said Hina Dedar, KU鈥檚 student of Mass-communication, adding that more than 50 companies across the province, have already demanded students from the KU鈥檚 institute, to offer them jobs with good salaries and benefits."
"Yang Xingping says every possible step will be taken for increasing cooperation with Punjab in different sectors

A Chinese delegation led by Sichuan province Vice Governor Yang Xingping met Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif here today.

Matters for enhancing cooperation between Punjab government and Sichuan in education, health, culture, information technology, infrastructure, agriculture and other sectors were discussed during the meeting. Both the leaders agreed upon taking speedy measures for promoting cooperation between Punjab government and Sichuan province in different sectors, while the vice governor expressed interest in opening an institute after great Chinese philosopher Confucius in Lahore.

Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that friendship of Pakistan and China is priceless in the world, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has given a historic investment package for the progress and prosperity of Pakistan. A new history of progress and prosperity in the region, including Pakistan, will be written due to CPEC vision of Chinese president, he added.

He said Chinese president has told the world nations that the solution to problems lies in dialogue and trade and economic relations. He said that the great vision of One Belt One Road (OBOR) will prove useful in linking countries of the region with one another. He said that people of Pakistan have started benefiting from the fruits of CPEC. He said that the entire nation has become aware of the importance of CPEC project.

Shehbaz Sharif said that work is being carried out speedily on energy, infrastructure and other projects under CPEC in Pakistan. He said, 鈥淥ur friends are happy over CPEC. Thousands of megawatt electricity will be generated with the completion of energy projects under CPEC and world will benefit when Gwadar Port will become fully operational.鈥?
He added that Punjab government has sent male and female students to China on its own expenses for learning Chinese language. He expressed the hope that more students will soon visit China in this regard. The chief minister stressed upon the need of taking immediate steps for increasing cooperation between Sichuan province and Punjab government in trade, economy and other sectors. He said that soon a delegation of Punjab government will visit Sichuan for increasing cooperation in education and other sectors.

Sichuan vice governor said that Punjab has a sincere, true and hardworking leader under the leadership of Shehbaz Sharif, due to which Punjab has made unprecedented progress. He said that all out steps will be taken for increasing cooperation with Punjab government in different sectors and will welcome the students of Punjab in universities of Sichuan. He said that his government wants to start air service between Chengdu, an important city of Sichuan, and Lahore. He said that there is a great potential in agriculture of Punjab and cooperation can also be enhanced in this sector. He expressed resolve to make Confucius institute in Lahore. Maximum exchange of visits by trade and business delegations will result in enhancing relations between Punjab and Sichuan, he added. He said that a close cooperation will be extended to Punjab government for enhancing cooperation in different sectors.

The Chinese delegation included Sichuan Province Vice Secretary-General and other senior officials. Chinese Consul General in Lahore, Yu Boren, was also present on the occasion. Provincial ministers Rana Mashhood Ahmed, Ch Sher Ali Khan, Jehangir Khanzada, Manshaullah Butt, Sheikh Allauddin, MPA Majid Zahoor, Kh Ahmed Hasaan, Planning and Development chairman, additional chief secretary and concerned officials were present on the occasion."
"KARACHI: The all-weather and time-tested friendship between Pakistan and the Peoples Republic of China seems to be almost a rare phenomenon in modern day diplomacy in terms of ascendancy of relationship between the two countries in a shorter span of time.

The diplomatic relations between both the countries were established on May 21, 1951 after Pakistan recognised China on January 4, 1950.

In mere 65 years鈥?time, these ties are now being often termed by both as taller than Himalayas, deeper than oceans, sweeter than honey and stronger than steel and these assertions are mere not rhetoric as they are very much based on the facts and ground realities. Over the decades, they were fostered on institutions to institutions and people to people as well as at the grassroots level forging deeper understanding and goodwill. The bilateral relations covered various fields, activities and the academic realm.

In this respect, the province of Sindh did not lag behind. A Confucius institute was established at the University of Karachi in 2013 as part of collaboration with Sichnan University. Confucius was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician and philosopher of the spring and autumn period of the Chinese history.

This institute is offering certificate programmes in Chinese language and culture at Karachi University accredited by the Hanban headquarters China.

A dean of Karachi University, Prof Dr Khalid Iraqi, informed that the Confucius institute has two directors, one from China and the other is from Pakistan whereas six instructors have come from China.

He said that in a major move, Karachi University has introduced Chinese language as a subsidiary subject at the undergraduate level and the enrolment at present is of 22 students, which has been termed as a good beginning.

The University of Karachi Confucious Institute Director Moin Siddiqui informed that the certificate courses of various levels including I, II, III and IV are being offered. The duration is four months and the current enrolment is 375 students.

Siddiqui said that the University of Karachi has introduced from January this year, Chinese language as a subsidiary subject for its Honours Programme and currently 22 students are studying.

He stated that the Confucius institute of Karachi University is also offering its services for conducting Chinese classes in other academic institutions in the metropolis.

Siddiqui informed that two classes each are being run at the Preston University and the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Karachi.

The number of students enrolled at Preston University is 75 whereas that at the IBA Karachi is 55.

Chinese classes at the Latif Ibrahim Jamal (LEJ), University of Karachi, have been planned and these would be started by July this year. There is also a move for the initiation of the students and the faculty exchange programme, he added.

Siddiqui apprised that with regard to the Confucius institute at the University of Karachi an agreement with the Chinese government was reached in November 2013 and the classes commenced two months later.

This very programme is going ahead at the university in a very smooth and successful manner. It will certainly expand further like the very close relations between Pakistan and China besides fostering goodwill and understanding among the people of the two countries.

In Pakistan, two other Confucius institutes are currently operating. Besides, University of Karachi, they are located at NUML in Islamabad and the Agriculture University Faisalabad. At the global level, there exist over 500 Confucius institutes in 133 countries around the world.

With the successful launch of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), there would be also need for expanding the number of Confucius institutes in Pakistan."
"The pictures of three British Muslim schoolgirls who left home to join the IS tell a harrowing tale of estrangement, heartbreak, lost control, indoctrination and abandonment.

Shamima Begum, Amira Abase (both 15) and Kadiza Sultana (16) led their families to believe that they had some local engagement, stole their jewellery to cover the travel cost and flew to Turkey to cross the Syrian border in order to be Jihadi brides for the Islamic state.

As CCTV footage of their travel later emerged, it was plain that timely action could have stopped them before they disappeared inside Syria. Imagine the agony of the parents who helplessly watched their daughters going through a well-documented path to self-destruction.

But the bigger question is, how did they end up here?

To an estimate, there are well over 20,000 foreign volunteers fighting alongside the IS in Syria and Iraq. A lion鈥檚 share of this number comes from Europe. Interestingly enough, the relative number of volunteers from the United States is not much.

Muslim communities in non-Muslim countries put a lot of emphasis on family values and the family as a unit. Hence it is not that easy for a young member to leave everything behind; the message that lures them out of their cozy environment must be potent enough to desert everything and go.

It is now believed that the IS recruiters employ a mix of the assumed victimhood of minorities: fear of the cultural other, peer pressure, greed and the 'end-ism' propaganda to attract new recruits.

See: IS may recruit locals by exploiting sectarian divide: official

The three missing girls are said to have been in contact with Aqsa Maqsood, their academy fellow who left for Syria last year. But had it not been for the vulnerabilities of the Muslim communities in these countries, such recruitment would never been so easy.

Amira, Shamima, Kadiza and Aqsa are all wearing the hijab or headscarf in the pictures. Is it possible that the Muslim communities鈥?newfound emphasis on piety in western countries has something to do with the failure of assimilation?

Europe鈥檚 failure of assimilation

European societies are known today to be multicultural and pluralistic, but they were not always like that. Only until a century ago, Europe was home to some of world鈥檚 most predominant colonial powers. Rudyard Kipling in his poem White Man鈥檚 Burden in 1899 called the people of colonies, 鈥測our new-caught, sullen peoples, half devil and half child鈥?

So when some of these people migrated to Europe, they were not immediately accepted or absorbed. Human zoos could still be found in Europe till the late 1950s. In a separate part of Europe, Hitler showed the world what could be done to minorities.

Discrimination at that time too was alive, many Muslims who migrated to Europe tried to transform their identity to fit in. Salman became Solomon, Zakaria chose to be called Zak. But that too was to no avail.

Read on: 'We are good Muslims, but Americans too'

Europe at that time was simply not ready to assimilate the immigrants; rejection led to reactions worldwide. One generation鈥檚 failure led the next to emphasise their roots, identity and culture of origin. Then came the Jihadist propaganda and the Muslim communities in Europe kept mutating to form a global cultural 'other', giving strength to the misplaced notion of the clash of civilisations.

An unfortunate binary

The end of the Cold War sparked speculations about the future of the human civilisation. Unipolarity led many to dream of a future free of conflict. Was it possible to conclude that Western values had finally and irreversibly triumphed?

It was at this time that one of the best political minds of our time, Francis Fukuyama, borrowed Hegel鈥檚 dialectics to conclude that the western ideal had won and this marked the end of man鈥檚 intellectual history.

His paper The end of history (later expanded into a book) remains a beautiful assessment of western universalism; it did not get the friendly reception that it deserved. A skeptical audience given to the mental Cold War straitjacket did not take kindly to the ambitious pronouncement. At the end of this piece we will see if Dr Fukuyama鈥檚 pronouncement was actually as premature as was declared at the time, but let us first focus on the unintended consequences.

In the September 1990 edition of the monthly Atlantic, Bernard Lewis, the renowned British-American historian and Orientalist, used the phrase 鈥榗lash of civilisations鈥?in an essay titled Roots of Muslim Rage.

But, while he had used the phrase in passing, it was Samuel Huntington 鈥?the well-known conservative scholar who is known more for political machinations than scholarly work 鈥?who put it to naked utilitarian use.

Sadly, while the works of Dr Fukuyama manifest great virtues of intellect, Dr Huntington鈥檚 work displays all the characteristics of premeditated spinning to give a specific direction to the historic causation.

Before we look into his 'clash of civilisations' thesis, let us take a closer look at the man.

So who was Samuel Huntington?

In her book Songs of Blood and Sword, Fatima Bhutto describes him as a 鈥榝rail old man鈥?who 鈥榳ore a woolly navy sweater in April and drank Coca-Cola from a Starbucks espresso cup鈥?

She also recollects how her father, as an undergraduate associate at Harvard鈥檚 Center for International Affairs, came across Huntington鈥檚 reputation of being the 鈥榖utcher of Vietnam鈥? Apparently, the man had 鈥榓dvocated the herding of villagers into clusters鈥? which instead of saving them, actually turned them into easy targets and collateral damage.

That was a bit of South Asian perspective, but there is more: The man could not get into the National Academy of Sciences in 1986, owing to the bitter opposition of one Dr Serge Lang, a Yale mathematician who accused Huntington of using 鈥榓 type of language which gives the illusion of science without any of its substance鈥?

Lang accused him of employing pseudo-mathematical arguments in his 1968 book Political Order in Changing Societies to reach the conclusion that in that decade, apartheid-afflicted South Africa was a 鈥榮atisfied society鈥? Dr Lang dedicated 222 pages of his 816 page book, titled Challenges (published in 1998) to this controversy.

From 2002: Musharraf opposes clash of civilisations

Whatever the validity of his challenge, it was strong enough to twice reject Huntington鈥檚 bid for member of the academy, despite his incredibly powerful knack for public relations.

I have narrated this episode to highlight that many believed that the author of The Clash Of Civilisation did not mind manipulating 鈥?even cooking up 鈥?facts to reach his favoured conclusions.

Engineering a clash

To prove that a clash between various cultures is inevitable, Huntington in his original article published in Foreign Affairs in 1993, based his definition of civilisation on the Arnold Toynbee interpretation of the term, which inextricably linked it to religious and cosmological outlook.

This was easy: Pick two of the most populous religious and cultural identities and project them as the new challenges after the communist threat. That way, you make the fear of the enemy so vast that you can give whatever policy advice in the resulting environment of paranoia.

Ideas can be powerful and offer tremendous power to their proponents. Hence, this flawed thesis.

Before the age of Toynbees, Spenglers and Durkheims, civilisation was only interpreted in the qualitative sense. There was assumed to be just one civilisation instead of many 鈥?civilisation versus benighted primitiveness. While that too can be considered a useful colonial tool, its interpretation of civilisation as an ideal was closer to the objective reality.

Why, then, go for a broken, reductionist definition of civilisation? Because that was dead useful.

Also read: Schimmel: Living counter-argument to 鈥榗lash of civilisations鈥?
Minds like Huntington鈥檚 are creatures of conflicts and it is in a polarised environment that they prosper. No doubt then, that compared to his other works, his clash thesis became a one-hit wonder.

Huntington (left) and Fukuyama.

If you are still not convinced that there was deliberate engineering involved here, the following quote from Michael Dibdin's novel, Dead Lagoon, might do the job. Huntington reproduces this quote in the beginning of his 1996 book The Clash of Civilisations and the Remaking of World Order:

""There can be no true friends without true enemies. Unless we hate what we are not, we cannot love what we are. These are the old truths we are painfully rediscovering after a century and more of sentimental cant. Those who deny them deny their family, their heritage, their culture, their birthright, their very selves! They will not lightly be forgiven.""

So, not only are there multiple civilisations and their clash imminent, but if you deny all this (and don't fight) you will not be forgiven.

Which civilisations might clash with the West, then? The Islamic and Confucius civilisations. Post-colonial Muslim countries which had constantly faced identity crises were bound to inhale this propaganda in a heartbeat. So they did.

From 2004: World on verge of clash of civilisations: Benazir

Likewise, a rapidly growing China was also looking for an identity more relevant in the changing times. Today, the organisation for the cultural promotion of socialist China abroad is not called the Mao Institute but the Confucius institute.

But if you want to know what Huntington really believed in, you will have to read his parting shot Who Are We?: The Challenges to America's National Identity, in which he professes the American WASP (White Anglo Saxon Protestant) identity is under threat from the Latino immigrants.

Is it not ironic that the man who identifies himself with something as broad as the western civilisation ends up with such a narrow identity?

Rise of doomsday cults in Islam

It was as if taking a cue from Huntington鈥檚 work, that fringe extremist groups in Muslim societies and connected minorities abroad started their propaganda about signs of the end of times. The clever plot in it is that Muslim eschatology predicts a series of wars in which if you choose to join the enemy鈥檚 ranks, you will never be forgiven (rings a bell?).

Henceforth, it was almost a self-fulfilling prophecy that given the political status quo in the Muslim countries, non-state actors will flourish with their brand of deadly terrorism. Therefore, the talk of a clash started gaining substance almost immediately after 9/11.

But Muslims were not the only community prone to these tendencies. While 9/11 and related terror incidents might have obscured the pre-existing undercurrents of end-ism in the rest of the world, they as good as almost set the stage for terrorism to come.

Shoko Asahara鈥檚 doomsday cult in Japan, Aum Shinrikyo carried out the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack, killing 13 and affecting thousands. Today, from al Qaeda to the Islamic State, most terror outfits in the Muslim world are hardly more than doomsday cults. But such groups, too, are running short of arguments.

While their machinations may continue for a few more years, their appeal can easily be done away through smart policy interventions.

Instability in the world order

There is no gainsaying that the world order will essentially stay unstable for now. It is a given. Like dwellers in the same house, people of the world are prone to quibbling.

However, such fights will not be along 鈥榗ivilisational鈥?lines but more realistic regional conflicts.

Crimea is one example. Yemen is another. Perhaps there is a better way to look at it than Huntington鈥檚. In his 2000 book Post Modern State and the World Order, British diplomat Sir Robert Cooper divides the world into three categories: Pre-modern, modern and post-modern.

'Pre-modern' countries are where state institutions are not functioning and the state loses monopoly on violence. A 'modern' state represents your average everyday countries, where state institutions are functioning properly but only just. A 'post-modern' state has only one state, namely the European state, where nation states give up limited autonomy to be united under one umbrella.

This explanation shows how the world is in different stages of development 鈥?divisions evidently, but not something you cannot avoid.

Also see: Stuck in 1947 鈥?Pakistan's 68 years of solitude

Otherwise Huntington鈥檚 prophesied clash ignores the fact that the Muslim world is not unified enough, and the Confucius world Confucian enough to pose a systematic challenge to Western thought.

End of history revisited

The incredible convenience of confrontation aside in the current fog of war, hate and anger; the real merits of Fukuyama鈥檚 basic thesis get obscured. However, they are there.

Recently, when Lee Kuan Yew died, with him got buried the talk of the so-called Asian values. Authoritarianism, oppression and illiberal ways have lost their appeal. Here and there, you find feeble attempts to justify them but they are losing impact.

While economists everyday try to improve the quality of capitalism with added checks and balances, the world has failed to represent coherent alternatives since the fall of Soviet Union. Liberal democracy is now considered the best institutional practice, when not publicly, privately.

Take a look: Embrace of civilisations

The notion of the religions of the world competing with the West as an alternative is also misplaced, given that Western values are essentially mundane in nature and religions after spiritual illumination. No matter how much it tries to convince you, the clergy, cannot deny that the two do not occupy the same space.

And that's why the triumph of the West doesn鈥檛 mean religion will lose its influence.

Far from that, as the world painstakingly marches to the postmodern finish line, pluralism will find space for all faiths. But if the world has not been able to come up with a cogent alternative to liberal democracy as an ideal, why should we not conclude that it has triumphed at least in theory?

In my humble view, there is no rational alternative to it all.

Those who have known Fukuyama鈥檚 works through secondary references should do themselves a service and go through the original source.

ISLAMABAD - The China-Pakistan relations will reap the windfalls of their all-weather strategic cooperative partnership as Beijing and Islamabad are on the verge of capitalising on massive opportunities of development to realise common dreams of the two Asian nations.

This was gist of the remarks given by the Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong at a media reception hosted here at the Chinese Embassy the other day about the wide-ranging opportunities China and Pakistan are working together for the mutual benefits of their people.

Ambassador Weidong declared the outgoing year as a year of achievements and a year of harvest for the two countries saying both Beijing and Islamabad have stepped up efforts for economic development in Pakistan by launching a number of bilateral projects including Economic Corridor and energy sector.

While sharing roadmap for bilateral cooperation between China and Pakistan in year 2014, Chinese envoy said that a number of Chinese companies have a keen interest in energy cooperation with Pakistan and are willing to participate in water, thermal, solar, wind, civil nuclear power generation projects. ""We should strengthen cooperation in all fields. We will take energy and infrastructure cooperation as a top priority, push forward the planning and the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor so as to promote economic development of Pakistan and improving livelihood of Pakistani people,"" he made these remarks while talking to newsmen at a reception hosted for Pakistani and Chinese media in the Chinese Embassy here on Monday night.

He said that bypass project of Attabad Lake of Karakorum Highway, Gwadar Port East Bay Motorway, the reconstruction project of flood damage highway, China-Pakistan Cross-Border Cable could be ""Early Harvest Projects"" of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The Envoy opined that both the countries should make full use of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and hold the second round of tax reduction negotiations on the second phase of the FTA. ""We should deepen cooperation in the fields of defence, maritime, agriculture, and law enforcement,"" he added.

Regarding China's support for Pakistan in capacity-building of independent development, he declared that his country would keep on encouraging Chinese enterprises to invest in Pakistan to promote the economic and social construction of Pakistan.

Stressing for promotion of people-to-people exchange, he said that China would send 1000 Chinese teachers to Pakistan in the next five years. ""We will continue to promote Hundred Youth delegation to exchange visits, invite more Chinese cultural delegations demonstrate Chinese traditional culture. We are also planning to build up a cultural centre in Pakistan,"" he added.

For enhancing the cooperation in regional and international affairs, he said that the two countries should push forward the Afghanistan peace process, support the SAARC Cooperative Process, maintain regional peace and promote common development. ""I believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, China-Pakistan traditional friendship and mutual beneficial cooperation will be enhanced to a new height,"" he added.

Expressing a need of sharing experiences in governing a state, further explore cooperation, he said that both the countries should further strengthen friendship by promoting exchanges of political parties, parliamentarians, local governments, think tanks, youth and media. While declaring the outgoing year 'a year of development, a year of achievements and a year of harvest', he said China-Pakistan relationship has stepped into a new stage, and ""we face more important opportunities of development.""

""We should deepen the strategic relations. China would like to work with Pakistan to keep the tradition of high-level exchanges, and enhance mutual support on issues involving the major interests of the two countries,"" he added.

""Why China and Pakistan enjoy such a unique friendship? It is because we always abide by Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, insist on mutual trust and support, equal treatment and sharing weal and woe over the long time,"" he added.

Sun Weidong said that it was because generations of the two countries' leaders always attach great importance to the consistent enhancement of bilateral relations. He said the Chinese government gave priority to the China-Pakistan relations in its diplomacy, while relations with China remain cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy, adding, ""It is because the two peoples have nationwide consensus on being friendly to each other.""

He said that this year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif successfully exchanged visits within 40 days, reached a series of important consensus, promoted strategic cooperation between our two countries, and raised a new upsurge in bilateral relations.

Gold fell sharply on Friday and was headed for its worst week in eight as hawkish remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve...
"Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, Chairman of Pakistan-China Institute and Dr. Zhang Daojian, Head of Confucius institute at National University of Modern Languages, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the successful completion of the first course of Online Chinese Language Learning. According to a press release issued on Friday, the MoU launching ceremony was held at the PCI office.

On the occasion, Senator Mushahid lauded the role of the Confucius institute in promoting the Chinese language and culture, not just in Pakistan but across the globe, and also highlighted the Pakistan-China Institute鈥檚 ongoing efforts for promoting Chinese language learning in Pakistan.

鈥淭he MoU institutionalizes the successful collaboration between PCI and the Confucius institute, and lays a foundation for the continuation of the program,which was held from February 17 to June 9, 2014.鈥?The Chairman said, adding the next course will begin in September.

The Program, a joint initiative of Pakistan-China Institute, LatifEbrahimJamalNationalScienceInformationCenter and University of Karachi, offers four month courses teaching basic Chinese language. The classes are held entirely via video conferencing and transmitted to universities across the country, with teachers from the Confucius institute serving the role of language instructors. The objective of the program is to impart Chinese language education to Pakistani students in order to equip them with linguistic skills and enhance socio-cultural understanding of China."
"The vice-president of the Confucius institute in Islamabad, Zhang Daojian, said he has had numerous requests over the past year from Chinese businesses in Pakistan that want to hire local Mandarin-speaking students.

鈥淪tudying Chinese is a great help to Pakistani students because many Chinese companies want to hire people who can speak English, Urdu and Mandarin,鈥?the China Daily quoted Zhang as saying.

Urdu is the national language of Pakistan, and both Urdu and English are the official languages.

鈥淟ast year a Chinese company asked me to recruit such talent, and I apologized because we had no students available,鈥?said Zhang, a former teacher at Beijing Language and Culture University.

The university established the Confucius institute in Islamabad in 2007. Zhang said some of the students who are fluent in Mandarin went to China for further studies, and the rest were hired in Pakistan.

鈥淕enerally, their jobs are really good, and most of them are working in banking or for leading Chinese enterprises,鈥?he said. The Confucius institute gave Mandarin lessons to 6,000 students in 2012 amid the nationwide drive to learn the language.

鈥淢andarin lessons are compulsory in the leading elementary schools here,鈥?Zhang said. The Confucius institute also co-hosted a series of cultural events to boost public diplomacy. One such event last year impressed Zhang with the Pakistani public鈥檚 enthusiasm for Chinese culture. 鈥淲e participated in a cuisine festival last year, and China鈥檚 booth attracted many people. The traditional friendship between the two neighbours is one of the reasons the Pakistanis want to learn Chinese,鈥?he said.

鈥淓conomic, political and cultural exchanges are frequent between the two countries, which naturally provide a major boost to the demand for learning Mandarin.鈥?Traditional Chinese culture also appeals a lot to the local people, Zhang added.

Although the Pakistanis have a strong desire to learn Chinese, Zhang said maintaining that enthusiasm was difficult. 鈥淪ome students have been brought up in well-off families, and they went to Britain or the United States for further studies after abruptly ending their Mandarin lessons,鈥?he said. Others who get posts at branches of Chinese companies in Pakistan are not interested in furthering their studies, Zhang added."
"Pakistani students, faculty members, staff and representatives of different social groups joined their Chinese living in Pakistan on Thursday in the festivities of 鈥淶hong Qiu Jie鈥? also known as the Mid-Autumn Festival, celebrated at National University of Modern Languages (NUML).

Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations were arranged by Confucius institute Islamabad (CII) and NUML in collaboration with Embassy of Peoples鈥?Republic of China on Thursday.

The chief guests of the event were NUML Rector Maj Gen (r) Masood Hasan and Cultural Counselor of Chinese Embassy Zhang Yinbao and it was attended by the students and faculty members of Chinese Department and CII, NUML, and other academic institutions including National University of Science and Technology (NUST), City School, Roots International and Roots School System DHA-2.

NUML rector said, 鈥淭he purpose of today鈥檚 celebrations is to express our solidarity with all Chinese nationals who are serving Pakistan under different capacities and to convey to them that they should not feel alone as Pakistan is their home and they are our family.鈥?
鈥淭he symbol of this festival 鈥榯he bright full moon鈥?is also analogous to our exemplary strong relations, which are higher than the Himalayas and deeper than the oceans,鈥?he added.

Earlier, young exuberant students from Roots School System DHA-2 dressed in the scarlet red traditional attires presented Chinese traditional dances having the fusion of umbrella dance, fan dance, ribbon dance and dragon dance presenting the richness of Chinese culture and mythology as well as message of peace, love and harmony.

A Chinese teacher of CCI entertained the audience with his Chinese song 鈥渢he waving national flag鈥?

Faculty members of Chinese Department recited a poem 鈥淲hen will the moon be full鈥?in course and Head of Chinese Department Xinghan and Nayyar Nawaz presented a duo Chinese song and received course clapping and applauses.

An International Chinese student rendered a beautiful solo performance on guitar and sang Chinese songs to leave his countrymen feel nostalgic.

In the end, another beautiful performance by students of City School made them all to stand up and sang 鈥淗umara Percham, Yeh Payara Percham鈥?and 鈥淧ak-Cheen Dosti Zinda Baad鈥?

The Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated on August 15 of the lunar calendar; it is one of the traditional festivals in China.

It is time for family members and loved ones to congregate and enjoy the full moon, which is an auspicious symbol of abundance, harmony and luck.

Families have a dinner together and everyone likes to eat moon cakes. Chinese people who live far away from homes want to go back to have a family reunion."

"鈥楽tunning鈥? 鈥榮pectacular鈥? 鈥榮urreal鈥?鈥?just three of the adjectives that were used to describe the acrobatic performance of a 14-member Guangdong Art Troupe from the People鈥檚 Republic of China, who presented their gravity-defying performances for the people of twin cities Islamabad and Rawalpindi at the Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA) auditorium on Friday.

Like Peter Pan, a character created by Scottish novelist and playwright JM Barrie (1860鈥?937), a mischievous boy who can fly and who never ages, the troupe members ranging from age 20-30 years, from the Guangdong Province of China, appeared perpetually youthful and vibrant as they put up breathtaking performances at the PNCA auditorium to mark the 鈥楥hinese Spring Festival鈥?

The Roots School System (RSS) and PNCA, in association with Chinese Ministry of Culture, Guandong Province Department of Culture and Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, organised back to back performances by the art troupe in the morning and evening of Friday.

In the first performance, the Chinese cultural troupe were also accompanied by the young students of Roots School System, while in the evening performances, the Chinese gymnasts displayed acrobatic skills with balancing techniques. The stage was decorated with with colourful flags of both time tested friends鈥?flags.

Young Rootsians, in the first scheduled programme, mesmerised the audience with the Chinese Performance titled 鈥楩estivals of China鈥?comprised of famous Chinese Ribbon dance, Umbrella Dance, Fan Dance and Stylized Martial Arts Performance to wish Chinese friends a very Happy Chinese New Year. The Chinese solo dances and gymnastic performances by the professional acrobatic troupe trained in China, had lasting impressions on the minds of audience.

RSS Executive Director Walid Mushtaq facilitated the students, who performed exhilarating Chinese performances, showing his commitment for continuous engagement with the Confucius institute for accelerated and far reaching Chinese Language programme and Summer Schools to China, so that the students could benefit from the exposure and education beyond borders.

In the evening, the PNCA in collaboration with the Chinese Embassy organised a traditional Chinese Art and Cultural Show with the same Chinese Acrobatic Cultural Troupe from Guangdong Province followed by a dinner reception.

Diplomats, civil society members, politicians, foreigners, students and PNCA officials were present on the occasion. The families of armed forces personnel were also invited to witness the event. The programme started with the performances of girls displaying acrobatic skills with balancing techniques. One of the stunning performances was an act of balancing a ceramic pot on the head by a performer. The artiste swung the ceramic pot on his hands and then landed the pot diagonally on his head, gaining the appreciation of the audience.

A female singer sang Hadeeqa Kiyani鈥檚 much acclaimed song 鈥楤ohe Barian鈥?that stunned the audience. She sang another catchy English number 鈥榃ho鈥檚 there鈥?in which she displayed her dancing skills too. The musical performance was followed by a magic show that delighted the audience, especially the children. The young magicians grabbed the attention by casting the spell of optical illusions, one after another, on the audience. Showing tricks with the help of cards, sticks, handkerchiefs, hats, newspapers and empty envelopes, the magicians entertained the families.

Last but not the least, 鈥楪olden Meditation鈥?was presented in which girls juggled golden balls on their hands and feet while sitting and standing upside down with such finesse that the audience was truly spellbound.

Acrobatics is a pearl in the treasure house of the traditional Chinese performing arts. The acrobatic art has existed in China for more than 2,000 years. As early as the Warring States Period (475-221 BC), the rudiments of acrobatics existed. By the time of the Han Dynasty (221 BC-220 AD), the acrobatic art or 鈥淗undred Plays鈥?further developed both in content and variety. In the Tang Dynasty, the number of acrobats greatly increased and their performing skills improved a great deal.

The present status of the Chinese acrobatics reflects the industry, resourcefulness, and un-daunting courage of the Chinese people. In the past 40 years and more, many Chinese acrobatic troupes have toured more than 100 countries and regions of the world and promoted friendship and cultural exchanges. At present, there are over 120 acrobatic troupes above the county level, and more than 12,000 people are involved in the performances."
"A 100-member delegation of All-China Youth Federation paid visit to National University of Modern Languages (NUML) on Monday as a part of its initiatives to promote and enhance China-Pakistan youth friendship exchange.

The delegation was headed by Deputy Secretary General of All- China Youth Federation, Wan Xuejun, accompanied by Chinese Cultural Consular to Pakistan, His Excellency Zhang Yiung Pao.

Dr Lei Weizhong, head of Chinese Department, head of Confucius institute, Dr Ge Le Sheng along with Chinese faculty members, students and other officials of the university warmly welcomed the delegations. Students holding Pakistani and Chinese flags presented bouquets to the members of the delegation.

All-China Youth Federation Deputy Secretary General Wan Xuejun, speaking at the occasion, said that love and affection of Pakistani people and youth overwhelmed them and each member of the delegation will be ambassador of this bond back to China.

He said that the delegation comprising of young Chinese businessmen, artists, teachers, researchers, media men, students and workers demonstrates eagerness of both nations to know about each other and develop close brotherly and people to people relations.

Every year hundreds of Pakistani students go to China and Chinese students come to Pakistan for studying different disciplines and these students guarantee a very bright future for the friendship of both the nations.

NUML Rector Maj-Gen (retd) Masood Hasan said NUML and Pak-China friendship were synonymous to each other.

He told the delegation that a flourishing Chinese department in main campus and many other regional campuses of NUML, and Confucius institute are prove of the fact that Pakistani people want to have cultural, social and economic ties with their brotherly neighbouring country. He said that NUML regularly arranges students and faculty members鈥?tours to China which help understand Chinese language and culture and subsequently they assist interest of Pakistan and China.

The members of the delegation also visited Chinese department, Confucius Department and Library and other different department of NUML where they were briefed about the functions of these departments by their respective heads. The Chinese and Pakistani students enchanted the slogans of long live Pak-China friendship.

The NUML rector and the DG presented university shields to the deputy secretary general of All-China Youth Federation, Wan Xuejun, Deputy Director International Department, All China Youth Foundation, Zhao Yaqiao, and the Chinese cultural consular.

"China Radio International (CRI), official broadcasting agency of the Peoples鈥?Republic of China (PRC) is celebrating 70th anniversary of its successful transmission. Established as Xinhua radio station in YANAN, northwestern China on December 03, 1940, CRI in its long journey has acted as a skylight on New China, besides being witness to the rise of an Asian superpower. After its relocation to Beijing, CRI has the unique honour of announcing dawn of New China on October 1, 1949.

Introducing China Radio International

It was April 1951, when CRI was renamed as Radio Peking and served as the official overseas broadcaster of PRC. Radio Peking in its formative years added additional languages including Russian, French, German, Spanish, Vietnamese, Thai, Kiswahili and Arabic to its transmissions to promote relations between new republic and rest of the world. Its portfolio had risen to 38 foreign languages by mid 1970s and played a crucial role as a bridge between China and outside world. With changing times, it also changed its nomenclature and renamed to Radio Beijing; however, in 1993, it got its present name China Radio International (CRI). As its name indicates, CRI is global in its outlook and broadcasts coverage of national and international affairs around the globe however, it is also an international media organisation that uses the most languages in its coverage of both national and international affairs amounting over 1500 hours per day. To better cover news events taking place elsewhere in the world, CRI began to establish overseas correspondent bureaus in 1980. The first two were set up in Tokyo and Belgrade. At present, CRI has 32 overseas bureaus across the world and dispatched over 400 correspondents. Representing CRI outside China, these correspondent bureaus are based in major cities with the mission of covering all its surrounding areas. CRI correspondents are always in the forefront of every breaking story to send back updated first-hand reports.

Building overseas bureaus

CRI also plans to build eight overseas regional bureaus in Europe, America, Oceania, Africa, Asia and Middle East. These regional bureaus will be the representative organisations of CRI in the respective continents and regions and will be responsible for the management and coordination of its overseas correspondents, and will oversee news gathering, programming, distribution, international communication and promotion of Chinese language and culture. After China鈥檚 reforms in the late 1970s, more and more foreigners had come to China for study, work, travel or business. In order to provide them with a better understanding of China, in 1986, CRI began offering domestic services with the launch of the English Channel, Easy FM-produced by its English Service-EASY. FM can be heard in major cities throughout China and is a favorite radio station with expatriates and English lovers in China. While dedicating itself to the reporting of both domestic and world events, CRI has also sponsored a variety of activities to promote friendship and cultural exchanges between China and other countries. No doubt that music is a language that can transcend geographical boundaries. Last year, to mark the Sino-Vietnam Friendship Year, CRI hosted a singing contest for both Chinese and Vietnamese singers by collaborating with major Vietnamese media outlets. More than 300 Chinese and Vietnamese singers participated in the contest.

Strengthening Sino-Pakistan diplomatic ties

The year 2011 marks the 60th anniversary of Sino-Pakistan diplomatic ties-CRI organised a reporting trip along Pakistan鈥檚 Indus river in May. The excursion included 20 reporters from CRI and other major Chinese media groups. This trip was very successful as mentioned by CRI Deputy Director-General, Madam Wang Dong Wei, while meeting with the writer in Islamabad. She described the trip a successful journey and said that during exploring the civilisations along the river Indus, she found that Pakistan is a beautiful country and its people are very friendly and have showed a lot of love and respect for China. She said that they would be delighted when Pakistani media delegation will visit China and explore Chinese civilisation along the river Yangtze, as this will be a unique opportunity to enhance people-to-people interaction and further strengthen the friendship ties. CRI delegation during their twelve days trip covered some 5,000 kilometers along the river Indus and produced hundreds of reports presenting a comprehensive picture of Pakistan. Similarly, at the invitation of CRI, a team of Pakistani journalists from major media groups will soon start their tour of the Yangtze river in China and will inform the people of Pakistan about their experiences.

Broadening language horizons

CRI after decades of growth has developed into one of the world鈥檚 major international broadcasters, both in terms of the number of languages and the quantity of programmes transmitted. Today, CRI broadcasts in 61 foreign languages across the world; the highest number of languages among all international electronic media. It aims to introduce China to the rest of the world, and vice versa, report global affairs to the world, and enhance understanding and friendship between Chinese and people of other countries. In recent years, CRI has followed its strategic goal of establishing a modern international broadcasting system and continuously improving the quality of its overseas broadcasts. Based on its traditional shortwave radio, CRI has vigorously promoted broadcasting programmes through overseas radio stations to reach more audiences. So far, CRI has set up 60 full-frequency FM or AM radio stations abroad, which broadcast in 41 languages. Their daily accumulated radio broadcasts now totals 1,200 hours and cover more than 60 countries and regions. In this edition of the show, we鈥檒l bring you the final part of the listeners鈥?knowledge contest marking CRI鈥檚 70th anniversary.

Establishing friendship through radio

Establishing friendship through radio is common for all 61 language departments in CRI. Letters and gifts displayed in the radio station鈥檚 exhibition hall stand as proof, which are rich and colourful tokens of love. A scarlet silk banner frequently catches people鈥檚 eyes. 鈥淭he gifts are from various listeners from Pakistan like other countries of the world, are displayed in Urdu Service First Asian Broadcasting Department Area apart from main reception area of CRI headquarters, which shows the attachment of listeners with CRI and CRI鈥檚 honour to their well wishers.鈥?Listeners鈥?support for China Radio International is not just limited to gifts and letters. Over the past seven decades, they鈥檝e voluntarily organised listeners鈥?clubs. Since 1961, the first listeners鈥?club, Beijing Radio Listeners鈥?Club, was founded in Japan. CRI鈥檚 listeners crossed five continents and have established a total of 3,165 overseas listeners鈥?clubs. The smallest clubs have dozens of members while big ones boast of thousands. They gather to share their experiences listening to CRI鈥檚 radio programmes, exchange knowledge about China and organise cultural exchange activities. In Pakistan, CRI listeners are actively working for the promotion of CRI programmes, since establishment of Urdu service in 1966; this year it was 45th anniversary of Urdu service and was celebrated across Pakistan in befitting manners. CRI also appreciates the listeners鈥?participation at club level and their reports were also acknowledged properly. Like Urdu service of CRI, present Incharge Ms Zhao Qiao (Mahvesh-her Urdu/Pakistani name), along with CRI Pakistan Bureau Office Reports, Ms Sun Lingli and Ms Wang Qainting (Ms Musrat-her Pakistani name) are actively working for the promotion of CRI and its objective to successfully enhance CRI-China education and social and cultural interaction programme.

Strengthening relations with listeners

To strengthen a bond with listeners, CRI has organised knowledge contests on various themes. Many listeners have been awarded prize trips to China. CRI staff and their overseas listeners are like members of a huge, but close family. While conveying the voice of China to different parts of the globe, CRI is also transmitting the message of friendship to people worldwide through the radio waves. With the joint efforts of its entire staff, CRI shows to its listeners that despite the geographical distances and their different ethnical and cultural backgrounds, the world becomes small to people who belong to CRI鈥檚 extended family. CRI has promoted its strategic adjustment by incorporating all means of mass communications鈥攔adio, television, newspapers, internet and mobile phone. In 1998, CRI began its online broadcasting service by setting up CRI online website. This internet communication platform offers news and information in a large number of languages among major international media. By logging onto the website, people can listen to CRI programmes anytime, anywhere and find all kinds of information about China. Now, the website鈥檚 visitors come from over 180 counties and regions. To help its listeners learn the Chinese language and culture, in December 2007, CRI established the first Confucius institute on the Air, offering a long-distance Chinese teaching mechanism via CRI鈥檚 multilingual international broadcasting network. Until now, CRI has set up 12 on-air Confucius institutes in different countries, allowing its global listeners to learn Chinese in their mother tongues. In January 2011, CRI launched China International Broadcasting Network or CIBN, in Beijing. It is a significant development for CRI in the field of new media. Based on CRI online and featuring 61 languages, CIBN is a multilingual and multi-terminal broadcast organisation that caters to audiences worldwide. The network is a convergence of websites, online broadcasting, network television and a mobile service terminal; all of which are multilingual. With the motto 鈥淚ntroduce China to the world, introduce the world to China, report everything in the world,鈥?the network serves as a new platform for CRI鈥檚 global audiences to learn more about China and the world.

While congratulating CRI on auspicious occasion of its 70th Anniversary, it will not be out of place to mention the vital role played by Urdu service in people to people interaction among Chinese and Pakistani public since 1966. We wish CRI all the best and success in years to come.

"Police officers and members of the investigation team gather near a passenger van, after a blast at the entrance of the Confucius institute University of Karachi, Pakistan April 26, 2022. REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro

A suspected female suicide bomber killed three Chinese teachers in Karachi on Tuesday, police and officials said, in the first major attack this year against nationals of long-time ally China working in Pakistan.

The three were among passengers on a minibus returning to Karachi university after a lunch break when the bomb exploded at the entrance to the university's Confucius institute, killing the Chinese teachers and a Pakistani national, police and officials said.

A separatist group, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) based in southwestern Balochistan province bordering Afghanistan and Iran, claimed responsibility for the blast, adding in an email to Reuters the attack was carried out by a woman suicide bomber.

It shared in the email a photo of her clad in a long shawl sitting with two children. The photo couldn't be verified independently by police or other officials.

Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon said, ""the reports we have got say they're Chinese."" He added they were teachers at the Confucius institute, a Chinese language and cultural centre.

""The information we've got is that the female bomber was most probably a student at the university,"" Memon told local Geo News TV.

A local guard and another Chinese citizen were also wounded in the minibus.

Local media showed CCTV footage of a woman dressed in black wearing a backpack standing close to the bus shortly before the bomb went off and sent up billowing clouds of fire and smoke.

Police did not verify the footage.

Local media showed the wrecked minibus dotted with shrapnel holes, and witnesses said the explosion was so big it rattled the windowpanes of other buildings on the sprawling campus.

The bombing was the first major attack against Chinese nationals in Pakistan since July last year when a suicide bomber blew up a passenger bus in northern Pakistan that killed 13 people, including nine Chinese working on a hydro-power plant.

Other attacks on Chinese working in Pakistan have taken place in Balochistan province, where separatist militants have waged an insurgency against authorities for decades.

Balochistan houses a deep-water port in Gawadar city which Beijing is developing under the China Pakistan Economic-Corridor (CPEC) project as part of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative to seek trade linkages with rest of the world.

The incident poses a major challenge to Pakistan's newly elected Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif who took power this month. He condemned what he called a cowardly act of terrorism.

""I am deeply grieved on the loss of precious lives including of our Chinese friends in the heinous attack in Karachi today,"" Sharif said in a statement. He promised a speedy investigation.

The Baloch separatist guerrillas, who say they are fighting for a greater share in regional resources of mines and minerals, usually attack gas projects, infrastructure and the security forces.

They also attack Chinese projects and workers despite Pakistan's assurances that it is doing everything it can to protect the projects.

Islamabad blames arch-rival neighbouring India for backing the insurgents, a charge New Delhi denies."
But the intensity and frequency of attacks started rising sharply last year, demonstrating the militants鈥?growing sophistication and aggressiveness. The number of terrorist attacks in Baluchistan nearly doubled in 2021 compared to 2020, according to the Pak Institute of Peace Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, and the pace has kept rising this year. Insurgents have started resorting to suicide attacks, and the April 26 bombing in Karachi showed a new willingness to use women as assailants.
"Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming on Thursday encouraged Bangladeshi students to participate in online learning in Chinese universities as the current COVID-19 situation delayed their return to the campuses.

""I hope that the students will be more patient and actively participate in online learning in Chinese universities,"" he said, adding that he knows many students are eager to go to China to complete their studies as soon as possible.

For the better, Ambassador Jiming said, when all the students are vaccinated, all international students will return to China and the door of China will always be open to students.

He said he is also ""very anxious"" over the current situation due to COVID-19.

The Ambassador was addressing a function virtually making the conclusion of the 20th ""Chinese Bridge"" Chinese Proficiency Competition for College Students

The Chinese Embassy in Bangladesh, Center for Chinese-Foreign Language Cooperation, Confucius institute at North South University hosted the event co-organized by the Confucius institute at the University of Dhaka."
"Recently, quite a number of reports have been published in both national and foreign media outlets about how two healthcare providers in Bangladesh issued fake Covid-19 certificates. Obviously, the negative coverage has tarnished the image of our nation abroad. We have had reports that the foreign minister had chaired a high-level, inter-ministerial meeting to discuss the immediate ramifications of these acts on our expatriate workers who are now staying abroad or planning to go back there after a few months of being in Bangladesh. The foreign ministry has also sent a letter to the Prime Minister's Office urging action in this regard so that those returning or planning to return to their work abroad can do so with authentic Covid-19 negative certificates.

Except for some isolated events, the last two decades moved mostly in a positive direction as far as the image of our nation is concerned. One may recall that during the post-war years, a smear campaign was unleashed by Kissinger, the then US foreign secretary, who could not reconcile with the defeat of his geopolitical vision in Asia. But Bangladesh, particularly since the 1990s, started turning around from a poverty-stricken country to a dynamic, rapidly growing one, acclaimed far and wide.

In the 1990s, as a regular newspaper reader in the US when I was a graduate student, I used to come across references of Bangladesh in the print media there. Out of curiosity, I started keeping a log of such references. Within a few years, the number crossed several hundred. After a quick analysis, I found around two-thirds of those references as negative, while one-third presented Bangladesh in a positive light.

Three issues then were highlighted as positive developments in Bangladesh: a) success in population control in a low-income country, which invalidated the Western concept of demographic transition that family size depends on income level; b) the microcredit system spearheaded by Dr Yunus' Grameen Bank in a country with huge poverty that also innovated some social engineering to provide people relief from extreme poverty. Finally, the resilience of the Bangladeshi people who, despite being badly battered by recurring climate disasters, can build back quickly. This trait of Bangladeshis earned commendation from the US press.

Now about two decades later, the basket of such positives has grown much bigger. Quite a number of our achievements in social and economic sectors are highly acclaimed the world over, touting Bangladesh as the newly emerging tiger in Asia. Our disaster management model, highlighted recently (after Amphan) in a column of The Guardian written by no other than Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, is emulated by many countries, both developed and developing. Bangladesh now sends the highest number of peacekeepers in the world. The huge sacrifices鈥攕ocial, economic and environmental鈥攖hat accompanied the sheltering of a million Rohingya refugees earned great accolades for the country. Also Bangladesh, being one of the countries that are most vulnerable to increasing climate impacts, is turning itself as a model of adaptation and learning for the world. This is being observed and commended globally.

Let me raise two pertinent questions here: why does the ""image"" of a nation really matter? How is it crafted in this age of electronic globalisation? There is a body of knowledge in International Relations called Image Theory. Economist Kenneth Boulding defined image as what we think the world is like鈥攏ot what it is really like. So, we act the way the world appears to us, not necessarily the way it actually is.

This mutual reading of nations is important in the international system. The terms ""image"" and ""perception"" are sometimes used interchangeably, but perception can be interpreted as wider than image, which can be viewed as the product of perception. The image theorists argue that the consciousness of shared events and experiences in a nation is of vital importance. Our fight for independence against Pakistan, constantly remembered through ritual observances and the historical memory of people, is such a great shared event that gives constant inspiration for our march forward. Likewise, the US Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address crystallise the national image in a form that is transmitted across generations. The historic 7th March speech of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1971, declared as a global knowledge heritage by the UNESCO, will be passed on to generations.

Thus, images are paramount in diplomacy, as they justify a nation's desired reaction or treatment toward another nation. Obviously, a positive image of a state is a major factor in determining whether and how easily the state can realise its goal. Thus a desired image can often be of greater value than a significant increase in military and economic power. We may recall that colonial powers used to try to change their ""imperialist"" image into a ""spreader of civilisation"" image. The institutions like the British Council, the Goethe Institut, the Confucius institute, student scholarships/fellowships and different exchange programmes are all meant for building positive images of the countries concerned.

However, until recently, the postures from top leaders and decision makers played the leading role in crafting the desired image. Now in the age of electronic globalisation, the postures of the masses are becoming more effective. Public diplomacy and people-to-people interactions are proving to be efficient tools in shaping the desired image. With rapid development of internet-based social networks, domestic developments and governance process are electronically transmitted in split seconds beyond borders, bypassing the official sources of information and communication. So, the difference between image and reality is getting more and more blurred. Obviously, image building is no more the responsibility or exclusive preserve of diplomats. I will argue that our diplomats are rather aide de camp鈥攖he camp being the whole of Bangladesh, where the behaviour of each individual, each leader and each institution, both within and without, matters, where astute diplomats actually serve as spokespersons on behalf of Bangladesh.

Against this backdrop, the behaviour of those unscrupulous caregivers鈥擩KG or Regent Hospital鈥攄oes not augur well for the country. The news of these negative developments spread like wild fire. The health minister's response to the question of his presence in an agreement-signing ceremony between his ministry and Regent does not add to our cherished image. Such indifferent responses from a minister in addressing a mortal threat like Covid-19 cannot be swept under the rug. A wired world makes no difference between an ostrich and a whistleblower.

By Yan Hou Source: Global Times Published: 2020/8/14 20:48:00

On August 13, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the US State Department has designated the Confucius institute U.S. Center as a ""foreign mission"". The Center will have to report basic information on personnel and property holdings to the department. Without doubt, this is another deliberate provocation after the US government enlisted nine Chinese media outlets as ""foreign missions"". The announcement will severely obstruct the cultural and people-to people exchanges between China and the US. As a result, the act has drawn strong criticism in and outside the US.

Out of ideological bias, the US government made groundless accusations against Confucius institutes. Not only does the decision run counter to the aspiration of the two peoples to strengthen communication, but it also goes against the global trend of cultural exchange and mutual learning among different civilizations. What the US government has done is political persecution and another proof that the notorious McCarthyism is creeping back and gaining strength. Pompeo's claim that the Confucius institute U.S. Center is ""an entity advancing Beijing's global propaganda and malign influence campaign on U.S. Campuses"" is completely unfounded.

First of all, Confucius institutes in the United States are established upon the voluntary application of American universities. In accordance with the principles of ""mutual respect, friendly consultation, equality and mutual benefit"", local universities, Confucius institute headquarters and Chinese universities sign legally binding cooperation agreement. Besides, the daily operation and management of all Confucius institutes is lawful, regulation-based,open and transparent. Since 2006, a total of 81 Confucius institutes and 13 Confucius Classrooms have been set up in the United States, with partners including Stanford University, the University of Maryland and the University of California, Los Angeles.

Second, Confucius institutes and Classrooms in the US provide the following services: to teach Mandarin;to train Chinese teachers and offer Chinese teaching resources;to carry out Chinese language tests and Chinese teacher certification tests;to provide consultation on Chinese education and culture;to facilitate linguistic and cultural exchange between China and other countries. Each and every of the services is aimed at promoting cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries and enhancing understanding and friendship between the two peoples. None of them has anything to do with politics, let alone foreign missions.

Third, as non-profit education organizations, Confucius institutes have long been praised for promoting Chinese language and culture around the world, strengthening cultural exchange as well as developing friendly relations between China and other countries. They play a positive and constructive role in meeting people's need to learn Chinese and contributing to cultural diversity. Chinese philosophy such as ""harmony without uniformity"" is widely acknowledged. So far, 541 Confucius institutes and 1,170 Confucius Classrooms have been set up in 162 countries and regions.

Confucius institutes originate in China and belong to the world.The splendid cultures created by different peoples are the common treasure of mankind. In a globalized world, all countries should promote cultural exchange, mutual learning and creativity to bring new vitality to the world. However, Pompeo and his like go against the trend out of their own political interest. He has already become the destroyer of international rules and world stability. He'd better not become the terminator of human civilization.

"How much of what we can implement of the treaty depends upon our efficiency, skill and discretion

It will be difficult to implement projects funded by China, thinks those affiliated with the projects. According to them, one of the main conditions imposed by China while promising loans was supplier鈥檚 credit. But using funds with this condition is tough. Regarding this topic, Honorary Fellow of Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya said: 鈥淗ow much of what we can implement of the treaty depends upon our efficiency, skill and discretion.鈥?On 2016, the Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Bangladesh and signed 27 treaties and MoUs on coastal disaster management, building Karnaphuli tunnel and infrastructure development. Among these, the proposal of a loan of 24 billion dollars was one of the major deals.Economic Relations Department (ERD) sources have said that, among those projects funded by China, building work for the Karnaphuli tunnel in Chittagong and a 1000 power megawatt thermal power plant in the Payra sea-port of Patuakhali, have started already. But most of the projects have not been touched yet. When questioned on why the work for most of the projects have not started despite the signing of the treaties, Finance Deputy Minister M A Mannan replied: 鈥淭he investment agreements signed during the visit of the Chinese president are considerably huge. It will take time to finish the work on them. 鈥淚t is not like the treaties will be implemented within one day,鈥?continued the deputy finance minister. 鈥淭here are no plans like that either. But since the treaties have been signed, they will be put into practice.鈥?Among those treaties signed, 28 development projects with $21.5 billion in foreign aid, an economic and technical cooperation agreement for $80.3 million grant and two framework agreements for constructing Karnaphuli tunnel and Dasherkandi plant are some of the major ones. Other than that, Memorandum of Understanding have been signed under China鈥檚 鈥淥ne Belt, One Road鈥?initiative, for cooperation, maritime cooperation, joint feasibility study on a free-trade area, new ICT framework, counter-terrorism collaboration, capacity building and sharing of information, tackling climate change risks, regional and international cooperation, and cooperation on power and energy sectors. According to ERD, China will invest $13.6 billion in private sectors alone. Other than that, investment agreements on government sectors worth several billion dollars have also been signed. The six projects whose plaques were unveiled by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Xi Jinping during the president鈥檚 visit include the Karnaphuli Multi-Lane Tunnel project in Chittagong, the Confucius institute at Dhaka University and the Tier-4 National Data Centre in Gazipur鈥檚 Kaliakoir, Shahjalal Fertiliser Company Limited in Fenchuganj, a 1320 megawatt thermal power plant in Patuakhali鈥檚 Payra and a 1320 MW coal-fired power plant in Chittagong鈥檚 Banshkhali. The four economic treaties are- a 1320 megawatt thermal power plant in Patuakhali鈥檚 Payra, a specialized economic and industrial zone for China, the expansion of the Dhaka- Sylhet highway and a broadcasting licensing treaty. Regarding the delay in starting the work for the projects, Finance Minister Abdul Mal Abul Muhit said, 鈥淎ll the projects do not fall under one ministry. The affiliated ministries are working towards completing the projects. Gradually, everything will be visualized.鈥?This article was first published on banglatribune.com"

"LUSAKA: China鈥檚 resilience, determination and hard work in transforming itself from a poor country to the second-largest economy in the world should inspire African countries in their development aspirations, a Zambian expert said.

Sande Ngalande, Director of the Belt and Road Research Centre of the University of Zambia, said Africa needs to look to China for advice and solutions on how to accelerate its development agenda.

鈥淐hina is a great country coming from a humble background.

鈥淚t offers us, especially in Africa, a great lesson about how a people united, a people focused on a common goal, a people speaking the same language, having one vision and getting together to fight anything in their way can make sure they achieve great things,鈥?he told Xinhua.

China, he said, has shown that it was possible to achieve anything because of what the Asian nation has done in the last couple of years in ensuring that the living standards of its people are improved.

According to him, the lifting of about 800 million Chinese people out of poverty was a phenomenon that African countries need to learn from on how to tackle poverty, adding that this was made possible by the dedicated leadership.

Ngalande, who is also Director of the Confucius institute at the University of Zambia, commended China for going out of its way in helping other countries, especially in Africa, to improve not only infrastructure but human capacity and technical services.

He thanked China for its generosity in giving Zambia a railway link to the sea at the time the southern African nation had problems in exporting and importing goods, adding that this was done despite the Asian nation having problems of its own.

鈥淏y the time they were helping us with the TAZARA (Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority), China was also a poor country and nobody could think they could do such a thing,鈥?he added.

He hoped that the friendship between China and Zambia will continue to blossom despite the Covid-19 pandemic. 鈥?Xinhua"
"SIBU: Scholars and professionals from both Malaysia and China have gathered here to brainstorm and discuss the impact large rivers have on human civilisation.

The inaugural Henan 鈥?Sarawak Great River Cultural Conference is jointly organised by the University of Technology Sarawak (UTS), North China University of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, UTS鈥檚 Confucius institute and the Sarawak Chinese Cultural Association.

At the opening ceremony for the conference in UTC 鈥榮 campus here today (April 23), the Prime Minister鈥檚 Special Envoy to China, Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing said the conference will also shine the spotlight on interactions by the Chinese civilisation, and its significance to strengthening cultural and educational exchanges between Malaysia and China.

鈥淩ivers are the lifeblood of the earth and the cradles that nurture human civilisations.

鈥淭he Yangtze and Yellow Rivers in China gave birth to the Chinese civilisation, while the winding Rejang River reflects the unique charm of Sarawak, and sparked the boom and prosperity of Sibu.

鈥淩ivers play a large and catalysing role in the evolution of towns and urban centres.

鈥淏ecause the descendants of Foochows saw the potential of Sibu being located on the confluence of rivers in the middle and lower reaches of the Rejang River, blessed with fertile land and a pleasant climate, they chose to settle on both sides of the Rejang from the beginning.

鈥淪imilarly, the fresh water nature of the river also played well to the shipbuilding industry and helped it flourish at the time. Sibu was indeed full of vitality and prosperity,鈥?he stated.

However, he said along its blessings, there are also dangers like the rise of the Rejang River having led to frequent flooding with increasing levels of siltation.

Unfortunately, he said the shallowing of the riverbeds of the Rejang and Igan rivers have caused much inconvenience and losses to the lives of the people there, and indirectly resulted in terms of population decline and outflow of resources.

Gradually, much opportunity for growth and development too has been lost, said Tiong who is also Dudong assemblyman.

He hoped that the conference participants share their experiences and insights into water conservancy projects and findings about how to effectively alleviate the failures of flood mitigation with a view to tackle frequent flooding in Sibu.

鈥淚n this matter, I have always advocated for reports on each river from time to time and to establish an information system for flood mitigation facilities in Sibu to improve their management and early warning capabilities.

鈥淭hrough this system, we will be able to have a clear assessment of riverbed siltation issues to come up with effective countermeasures instead of relying on mere pumping stations or retention ponds.

鈥淲e should do this instead of passively waiting for flood response parties to carry out their rescue work, assist victims, and then rebuild the disaster-hit areas and other measures. After so many years, this passive approach is undoubtedly a drain on the taxpayer鈥檚 money and public resources, 鈥?he pointed out.

Tiong, who is also Bintulu Member of Parliament argued that only a water control policy to meet modern demands could realise a harmonious co-existence and steady progress between human civilisation and nature.

Therefore, he said while planning to implement large and small development plans in an area, whether it is for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes, careful calculations and planning should be thought out to create a flood mitigation system adapted to the local conditions.

This should include reserving land and spaces for the optimal use of drainage which conforms to the terrain, along with regular maintenance schedules and monitoring, he said, adding the importance of flood drainage and water control to reap its full benefits should not be ignored or downplayed.

鈥淲ater can both carry a boat or capsize it. We owe much to the natural advantages that the Rejang has given us, to Sibu. It has supported our civilisation鈥檚 development and the livelihood of our people for a long time.

鈥淏ut now Sarawak鈥檚 鈥榤other river鈥?is strained by the excessive development and lack of proper management we have let her endure. She is losing her important rainwater reservoir function.

鈥淚t is time for us to think about what went wrong and start turning the tide. We must begin to mitigate the water flow between the rivers and restore the riverbed鈥檚 capacity to achieve the long term goal of water management,鈥?he pointed out.

Tiong hoped academic and professional institutions such as the UTS could open the doors that lead to better international scientific research cooperation, learn from the achievements of many other countries in the field of water conservancy and promote more technology transfer and knowledge sharing.

At the same time, through these collaborations, can expect to see more high-quality education resources for Sarawakian students, and cultivate more talents in the water conservation engineering field for the state, he said.

鈥淭his is included in my previous discussion with our Prime Minister to welcome more local universities such as UTS and others to participate in the preliminary study on the Sarawak rivers.

鈥淚 hope that students can apply this knowledge and give back to their hometowns to promote more vigorous, sustainable development,鈥?Tiong added.

Among those present at the event were UTC鈥檚 Vice Chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Khairuddin Ab Hamid, Chairman of Sarawak Chinese Cultural Association Albert Lau Pek Kii, Chairman of the Sarawak United Association of Private Chinese Secondary School of Management, Temenggong Datuk Vincent Lau Lee Ming and Chairman of Malaysia-China Chamber of Commerce, Sarawak, Datuk Lau Nai Hoh."
"Writer highlights riverine community, history and culture in award-winning essay

WHEN writer Chang Yi started her little project, 鈥楬istory of Baram鈥? six years ago, her intention was to explore, discover and tell the story of Baram River, the people living along its banks and the development of the communities there.

Early this year, she was blessed with the opportunity to showcase it to a larger audience, namely those involved in the inaugural international essay competition run in conjunction with the 鈥楬enan-Sarawak Great River Culture Conference鈥?

Organised by North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power (NCWU) and University of Technology Sarawak (UTS), and co-run by the Confucius institute at UTS and Sarawak Chinese Cultural Association, the competition was further classified into the topics of 鈥楥hinese Historical and Cultural Inheritance鈥? 鈥楪reat River Culture鈥? 鈥榃ater Culture鈥? and 鈥榃ater Ecological Conservation Governance鈥?鈥?all meant to highlight and explore the interactions between rivers, humans and civilisations, focusing on the China-Malaysia ties.

For the essay, Chang had roped in former lecturer Prof Vincent Huang, who hails from Marudi, as a co-writer, sharing his knowledge of Baram history involving Marudi, Lubok Nibong and the areas in between.

鈥楽tory of legacy鈥?
Regarding the topic for the essay, Chang said she 鈥榪uickly decided鈥?to tell the story of the Chinese immigrants in Baram.

鈥淭here was another person who took part in the competition, but the focus was on Rajang River; hence, the instant decision of choosing Baram River, which I have been exploring and researching its history over the past six years,鈥?Chang, who has 32 years of teaching experience, told thesundaypost.

The essay co-written with Prof Huang, entitled 鈥楢 Legacy of Chinese Spirit in Poyut-Lubok Nibong Foochow Settlement, River Baram Valley, Sarawak in the 20th century鈥?described how Baram had shaped the life, food, transportation and community dynamics of the small migrant Foochow population in the Poyut-Lubok Nibong area.

The original population of Baram comprised the Kayans, the Kenyahs, the Kelabits, the Berawans, the Kiputs and the Malays.

In 1927, a pioneer Hii Nguong Sherng brought in a group of 90 Foochows 鈥?some of whom were from Sibu, and some from Third District (San Du) of Minqing in the Fujian Province of China.

They settled down in Baram and became rubber tappers and padi farmers, following a negotiation with the Rajah of Sarawak. Within five years, 2,000 rubber trees were planted and subsequently, a sustainable enclave was carved out of a 2,000-acre area in the vast mid-valley of Baram.

The Foochow community became an important part of the large Baram society, in that they were associated with food production, the rubber industry and generally, the socio-economic development of the area.

The essay also touched on the inevitable changes, politically and economically, by the descendants of the pioneers who had chosen to remain on the land tilled by their forefathers in the 1920s.

The wisdom and cultural legacy of the Chinese community left a special mark on this riverine enclave of Poyut-Lubok Nibong in Marudi.

The presentation of the joint essay by Chang and Prof Huang, conducted via video conference, captured much attention and praise from the large audience, and it later won first prize in the competition.

Riverine community

Locally known as 鈥楤atang Baram鈥? Baram River is the second longest in Sarawak. The stretch begins at Long Lamai and ends at the Baram section of the South China Sea.

Along the river are towns and villages such as Long Lama, Long Miri, Long Naah, Long Akah, Long Selatong, Long Apu, Long Panai, Long Silat, Long Tungan, Lio Mato and Long Lamai.

Marudi town is situated about 100 kilometres inland from the river.

Back on the Foochow community in Baram, the majority of them are living in Marudi, Sarikei, Sibu and Bintangor, and the common clans are the Hii, the Kiing, the Huong and the Tie.

It is no secret that the pioneer folks had worked really hard, starting everything from the ground up and always pulling their weight in whatever enterprises to ensure their families would prosper going forward.

However, the parents never failed to instil in their children the positive attitude and noble traits that would keep them on their feet while striving for success.

A son of a rubber tapper, Prof Huang, 70, said the most treasured value for him was not any wealth, but the wisdom about family and life imparted by his father, who had taught him to live humbly.

鈥淚 was young and na茂ve, easily tempted by things that seemed out of the ordinary from our simple life in Marudi. My father kept on telling us not to think about obtaining success and wealth the easy way.

鈥淲orking hard is the core, and education plays a great part in it,鈥?said the scholar.

He admitted that during his childhood days, there were times when he did not attend school; instead, he would help out at the rubber estate, where he learned creativity out of the trade.

鈥淚 remember during that time, the children would collect the latex left in the cups and those that dripped onto the ground.

鈥淭he Foochows called this uncollected latex 鈥榥engsei鈥? and they鈥檙e just droplets here and there.

鈥淗owever we, the kids, looked at it as an opportunity to earn extra pocket money.

鈥淧atiently, we would collect whatever bits that we could find, gather and send them to the rubber mill to be processed. The few coins that we earned made us happy, but beyond that, the experience actually taught us that to make something happen, we must work for it 鈥?plus, some patience and creativity,鈥?he said.

Another important lesson, said Prof Huang, was that education could break the vicious cycle of poverty.

This had inspired him to pursue teaching as a career. After having graduated from a local college, he enrolled in a Teacher鈥檚 Training School.

Overall, Prof Huang has 40 years鈥?worth of teaching experience, having served at various primary and secondary schools, as well as at the Teachers Training Institute Miri Campus as a lecturer.

Chang Yi, 73, is also a retired lecturer, having taught English at Sarawak Teachers Training College.

鈥楳ore than just stories鈥?
According to Chang, the history of Baram has not been well-documented and thus, she believes that preserving it through writing would help the younger generation understand the background of this important part of Sarawak鈥檚 past.

鈥淲hile visiting and listening to the stories related by the descendants of the pioneers, I realised that they鈥檙e more than just stories. Understanding our history and values allows us to appreciate our roots.鈥?
In addition, Chang 鈥?also a freelance photo-journalist 鈥?had co-authored several books previously and in this respect, she was looking forward to publishing one that would properly depict the history of Baram.

鈥淯sing Facebook as a platform, I have set up a page 鈥楬istory of Baram鈥? where I share bits and pieces of its history.

鈥淭he response is beyond my expectations. There are many different comments coming from different perspectives, and they all contributed immensely to our understanding of the history.鈥?
Chang said her participation in the essay competition did help the audience in China learn more about the history that their countrymen had established in Borneo after their arrival nearly a century ago.

鈥淲ith the collective information that I have obtained over the years, releasing a book on this subject would be my ultimate dream,鈥?she added."

鈥淥n behalf of UCTS, we would like to thank Tsinghua University for their caring and kind attitude in helping us during this difficult time,鈥?Wong told a press conference here yesterday.

He also shared how logistics have become a problem when it comes to transporting goods between China and Malaysia, saying the donated face masks had been stuck at the airport in Shenzhen for some time.

Adding on, he said another batch of protective gear from Tsinghua University will soon arrive in the state.

On a separate matter, Wong said a Confucius institute was supposed to be launched at UCTS but had to be postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Meanwhile, UCTS vice-chancellor and president Professor Datuk Dr Khairuddin Ab Hamid said the university is assisting Sarawak Multimedia Authority to produce face shields, using 3D printers and laser-cutters.

He said the university has so far supplied about 600 face shields to Sibu Hospital for the use of frontliners."
"VIENTIANE (Xinhua): The future China-Laos railway operation staff have started receiving Chinese language training at the Confucius institute of the National University of Laos in the Lao capital Vientiane.

An inauguration ceremony for the intensive Chinese language learning class for the first group trainees for the railway's operation was held at the institute on Tuesday (June 23) by the Laos-China Railway Co, Ltd. (LCRC), a joint venture based in Vientiane, in charge of the railway's construction and operation.

Jiang Shuming, an official with the LCRC, introduced the recruitment and training process at the ceremony, saying that since Feb 27 when the company launched the recruitment of the Lao trainees for the railway operation, the company has selected the first 248 trainees for the four-phase training, including Chinese language education, professional railway theory, on-site practical training in China's Kunming and specific pre-job skill training.

After passing tests, the Lao trainees will become railway workers as train drivers, dispatchers, locomotive and basic equipment maintenance personnel.

The intensive Chinese language class will last for 10 weeks at the Confucius institute. The follow-up selection of the second and third groups of the local trainees has started, and is expected to be completed in July. Altogether, 600 Lao trainees will be selected, said Jiang.

Saykham Phanthavong, deputy director general of the Vocational Education Department under the Ministry of Education and Sports, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the LCRC for selecting and training Lao railway talent, hoping that the trainees will become the backbone of the country's railway technology.

Anongdeth Chanthalath, deputy cabinet chief of Laos-China Cooperation Commission, said the operation and management of the China-Laos railway stage will become a new challenge, especially at its beginning period.

Laos lacks related experience and needs Chinese to train the staff, said Anongdeth, hoping the Lao youngsters to seize this opportunity learning railway expertise, so as to well manage and operate the first modernised railway in Laos.

Xiao Qianwen, general manager of the LCRC, introduced that the construction of the China-Laos railway is progressing steadily, with 90 per cent of the civil engineering completed, and station engineering is fully started.

The company's focus will shift from construction to operation at the end of this year, said Xiao, adding that the China-Laos railway will become an ideal platform for Lao staff to work.

The China-Laos Railway is a strategic docking project between the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Laos' strategy to convert from a landlocked country to a land-linked hub.

The 422-km railway, with 198-km tunnels and 62-km bridges, will run from Boten border gate in northern Laos, bordering China, to Vientiane with an operating speed of 16kph.

The electrified passenger and cargo railway is built with the full application of Chinese management and technical standards, with its construction starting in December 2016 and scheduled to be completed and operational in December 2021. - Xinhua"
KUALA LUMPUR: The government of participating countries that have interest in China鈥檚 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects need to undertake the necessary economic and financial stress test before implementing it.In making the call, AirAsia X Bhd Chairman Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz said the stress test could help the country to have a better assessment on the viability of the project and avoid problems such as overpricing especially when it involves financing packages attached to the project."This is to evaluate the long-term debt sustainability, which involves hundreds of millions and for some country, that could have a big fractured to the total gross domestic product."The government must view the project(s) from not only the socio-economic perspective but (also) do that without politically tinted lenses...a wrong way to do a project," she said in her keynote address at the 3rd Belt and Road Public Forum here on Thursday.Rafidah, who was the country鈥檚 former international trade and industry minister said, all BRI projects considered for implementation must be anchored on domestic-needs, optimal economic benefits, employment opportunities which in turn would contribute to the country's long-term socio and economic development.She said the country should not simply jump into the BRI bandwagon without taking into account the local conditions, to prevent destructiveness on the local market."We want a project that has a legacy of positiveness and it can only be done if right up front, this confidence is put into place."This the socio-economic consideration and not purely bottom line," she urged.Popularly dubbed as Malaysia's "Iron Lady鈥? she also pointed out that the BRI project might have short term result but its long-term liability must be taken into consideration too, as there is no guarantee the same government will be in place as it could be changed through an election.The implementation of BRI projects according to her, must be transparent with strict adherence to universally acceptable governance and business ethics, terms and conditions.She explained, the project should not be a stand-alone initiative as it must be integrated into the overall economic blueprints of the nation, for it to be relevant and accepted by the people with its results in tandem with the initially targeted benefits.Rafidah also questioned why air transport are left out from such a big infrastructure initiative, believing the maritime and land transportation mode are not enough to boost greater connectivity.She said all three modes of transportation must have complementarity which would be more beneficial for the world鈥檚 physical connectivity and efforts to reduce the travelling time."The shortest is by air. How fast a ship and train can go? But how fast a plane can go?"How you can miss out one of the important connectivity vehicles and (at the same time) you are (talking about) boosting trade?"Nobody ever talks about air connectivity, in fact eventually 20 years down the line, you feel that is the most important connectivity with more low-cost air travel," she elaborated.The World Bank Group estimated the BRI transport project if completed, could reduce travelling time along the economic corridors by 12 per cent, increasing trade between 2.7 per cent and 9.7 per cent, increasing income by up to 3.4 per cent and lift out 7.6 million people from extreme poverty."If we can include air connectivity, I'm sure we can see a substantial difference in the numbers," added Rafidah.The one-day forum was organised by the Confucius institute at SEGi University. Also present was Yu Jun, political affairs counsellor of China in Malaysia. - Bernama
"KOTA KINABALU: Sabah needs more investors to come in, said Chief Minister, Datuk Seri Panglima Shafie Apdal.

Speaking at the China Consulate鈥檚 Sabah Chinese New Year celebration at Wisma Hakka on Saturday night, Shafie added that the State welcomes investments from China and that the State government would be making adjustment to make it attractive.

He also said the State was keen to learn more about the culture and people of China and hoped to build a better rapport between the business communities of Sabah with China.

He noted that China is located near to Sabah and that the State has been seeing a large influx of visitors from the republic to Sabah and namely, to Semporna where he is from.

He urged Chinese companies to set up their business here, and encouraged them to employ the locals of Sabah.

Present at the event were Head of State, Tun Dr Juhar Datuk Mahiruddin and his wife, Toh Puan Norlidah Tan Sri RM Jasni, Deputy Chief Ministers Datuk Christina Liew who is also Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister and Datuk Wilfred Madius Tangau who is also Sabah鈥檚 Trade and Industry Minister.

Meanwhile, Consul General Liang Caide said that the cooperation between China and Sabah in various fields had been further promoted in the past year.

He said that more Chinese were coming to Sabah for tourism and that last year, the number of Chinese tourists visiting the state were 593,600, an increase of 37.7 percent.

He said that this exceeded the original target of 500,000 people.

鈥淭his shows that Sabah is gaining more popularity in China, and it has become one of the favorite tourist attractions for Chinese. At the same time, there are more people from Sabah visiting China. Last year, the Consulate General issued more than 31,000 visas, an increase of 22 percent compared with the previous year. At present, the number of direct flights from Kota Kinabalu to various cities in China has reached 121 flights per week, namely an average of 17 direct flights per day between China and Sabah,鈥?he said.

At the same time, Liang also said that more Chinese companies were coming to Sabah for cooperation, investment and development in areas including infrastructure, real estate, electrical power, telecommunications, plantation, aquaculture, tourism and hospitality, logistics, manufacturing and others.

鈥淐hinese companies have brought capital and technology to Sabah, promoted the construction of infrastructure and the development of various industries in Sabah, created more jobs, injected more vitality into the local economy, and brought real benefits to the local people,鈥?he said.

He also said the first Confucius institute in East Malaysia, jointly established by the Changsha University of Science and Technology in China and the University of Sabah, would soon be launched.

鈥淲e hope that the Institute will cultivate more talents who understand the languages and cultures of both countries and master professional skills, contributing to the China-Malaysia friendship and China-Sabah cooperation,鈥?he said.

Later, after the event, reporters waited to get Shafie鈥檚 input on the Prime Minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamed鈥檚 announcement that Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) would be coming to Sabah after all but were turned down.

The announcement finally laid to rest months of speculations that PPBM will spread its wings to the state.

Former Sabah UMNO leader, Datuk Hajiji Haji Noor Feb 6 stated that PPBM would come to Sabah soon, but did not mention when.

The decision by the Federal based party has received mixed reactions from the people of Sabah.

Datuk Seri Lajim Haji Ukin was among those who welcomed the party鈥檚 entry into Sabah."
"BEIJING: China plans to 鈥渙ptimise鈥?the spread of its controversial Confucius institutes, the government said, institutions to promote Chinese language and culture that have been criticised by some for spreading Communist Party influence.

In 2004, China began setting up the government-run bodies, whose stated mission is to satisfy soaring global demand to learn Chinese.

But they have drawn criticism, especially in the United States, for being little more than a propaganda arm of the ruling Communist Party, assertions denied by both the institutes and the government.

The Confucius institute will remain a key government policy, a document on modernising China鈥檚 education system issued late on Saturday by the party鈥檚 Central Committee and the cabinet showed.

鈥淥ptimise the regional distribution of the Confucius institute, strengthen its abilities and building, and fully raise its educational standards,鈥?they said in the statement, released by the official Xinhua news agency late on Saturday.

鈥淪trengthen work on the teaching of Chinese internationally,鈥?they added, without giving details.

Such broad statements are typically followed weeks or even months later by more detailed policy documents that focus on implementation.

Some US legislators, including Florida Senator Macro Rubio, have been critical of the more than 100 Confucius institutes hosted at universities across the United States, calling them a vehicle of Chinese influence on international higher education.

Some major US colleges, including Pennsylvania State University and the University of Chicago, have cut ties with the institute after professors complained its programmes were Chinese propaganda wrapped in culture and language education.

The document added that China would improve educational opportunities for students from countries in the Belt and Road initiative, speeding up the grooming of international talent and helping foreign students return home to better job prospects.

China opened its first so-called Silk Road School last year in Suzhou in the eastern province of Jiangsu. About 100 students from countries in the initiative received scholarships as they study China鈥檚 economy, politics, law and culture.

Students from Belt and Road countries such as Pakistan and Nepal are also eligible for scholarships to other universities in China.

The Belt and Road initiative, championed by President Xi Jinping, aims to link China by sea and land with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through an infrastructure network on the lines of the old Silk Road.

Aside from boosting trade and investment, Xi aims to boost exchanges in areas such as science, technology, culture and education. 鈥?Reuters"
"BEIJING: Malaysian student Muha颅mad Shahmeer Mohd Nash颅rul鈥檚 years of studies in a Chinese school paid off when he shone on the global stage here, thanks to his fluent Mandarin.

The accounting undergraduate of Universiti Teknologi Mara came in second among more than 100 students in the 16th Chinese Bridge Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign College Students, the biggest of such contests worldwide.

He also won the Excellent Elo颅quence award in the competition held in Changsha, China鈥檚 Hunan province, on Saturday.

The 22-year-old from Penang returned with a trophy and a scholarship to study in China. He was only seven points behind the winner, a student from Sudan.

鈥淚 am very happy. Thank you to my mother for insisting that I go to a Chinese school,鈥?said Muhamad Shahmeer, who is of Malay and Chinese parentage, in a telephone interview yesterday.

The annual competition is organised by the Confucius institute Headquarters to promote the development of Chinese education overseas and enhance students鈥?understanding of the language.

Participants have to win the preliminary rounds in their respective countries before they can move on to the semi-final and final rounds in China, where they compete against each other over their language skills and general knowledge.

Shahmeer, who is a part-time singer, also plans to expand his singing career to China.

Another Malaysian, Fahmi Muha颅mad Rasyid from Universiti Malaya Pahang, was among 145 participants from 112 countries to make it to the semi-final.

Muhamad Shahmeer, who also speaks Hokkien and Cantonese, completed his primary education at SJK (C) Li Tek B and continued studying Chinese at SMJK Heng Ee.

He moved to St Xavier鈥檚 Institution in Form Four because he wanted to take up Islamic studies.

鈥淏ut I did not give up on Chinese. I love the language because it is so unique, broad and profound. If I mispronounce a word, it takes on another meaning,鈥?he said.

He also thanked his primary school teacher Seen Mor Lian, who taught him Chinese for six years.

Muhamad Shahmeer encouraged those who wished to pick up any language to learn it fast.

鈥淚t is always better to know more, be it language or other knowledge. You never know where you will end up in the future. The more you know, the more opportunities lie ahead of you,鈥?he said.

Malaysian Ambassador to China Datuk Zainuddin Yahya congratulated Shahmeer on his success.

鈥淗e has made all Malaysians proud and I hope his achievements will inspire others to take up Mandarin,鈥?he said."

"Free Chinese lessons offered

Officials at the Justice Ministry are to be funded to learn Chinese.



Justice Minister Ang Vong Vathana and the Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Xiong Bo announced after a meeting yesterday that China will provide scholarships to enable officials to study outside their working hours.



Ministry spokesman Chin Malin said the Confucius institute in Cambodia would provide three classes in Mandarin and another on Chinese law.



鈥淢any Justice Ministry officials are interested in learning Chinese,鈥?he said, adding that about 170 had already registered and could be sent to China to continue their studies after they achieve a certain level of proficiency.



鈥淲e can learn a lot from China about how to develop and reform the economy,鈥?Mr Malin added.



The ministry is also encouraging officials to learn other languages, in particular English and French."
"Chinese influence in Australia is growing across a broad front, from political donations to Confucius institute teachings in primary schools and university institutes funded from Beijing. These continuing efforts to spread soft power have found a new friend, with an announcement that content from Chinese newspapers and wires will run in Australian media and on the Sky TV cable television channel.

China Watch is a monthly eight page lift-out that will run in the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and the Australian Financial Review. It is prepared by China Daily, the English language paper run by the Communist Party that explains China and government policy to foreigners.

The arrangement has gained plenty of critics including Media Watch, shown by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which suggested times are so tough for Fairfax (which announced yet another round of job cuts in early May) that the company 鈥渁greed to take money from the Chinese for spreading their propaganda.鈥?
Nor is it the first such agreement between Chinese media and Australian media; Sky News has a deal with the People's Daily and Xinhua with the Australia-China Relations Institute, headed by former Labor Foreign Minister Bob Carr.

It is not even the first agreement between Fairfax and a foreign news agency looking for purchasable soft power. The Age's Green Guide, a green-hued weekly TV guide, featured a multi page special on Russia over Christmas, and has been doing so on and off for some time. Russia Beyond the Headlines, like China Watch, is a government-run effort that appears in newspapers around the world.

The current deal was concluded when the head of the Central Propaganda Bureau of the CCP, Liu Qibao, was a guest of the government and signed contracts with Australian media companies.

Not everyone is convinced of pernicious influence. Dingding Chen, an assistant professor at the University of Macau and non-resident fellow at the Global Public Policy Institute, told Asia Sentinel 鈥渢his sort of soft power efforts (sic) are very limited for several reasons. First... as few people would read it anyway. Second, China Daily is not that high quality in terms of story-telling.鈥?He also pointed out that both the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post had their own China Watch deals, to limited success or attention.

While Fairfax鈥檚 China Watch feature is limited to a paper lift-out both the WSJ鈥檚 and the WP鈥檚 editions can be seen online. The content is largely boilerplate communist tropes: celebrating culture, reporting on the President鈥檚 welcome in Washington, and bellicose railing against arbitration in the South China Sea or Freedom of Navigation Patrols.

Australians more generally do not think deeply about Chinese 鈥榩ropaganda鈥?or its soft power. China is largely seen in economic terms (two way trade is at A$670 billion or 鈧?30 billion) and worries center on Chinese ownership of land, both big parcels of it or of wealthy individuals 鈥榖uying up鈥?Australian real estate and driving prices up. According to a 2015 Lowy Institute poll around 15 percent of Australians see China as a military threat; 77 percent see it as an economic partner.

Rory Medcalf, of the National Security College at the Australian National University (ANU) told the AFR, 鈥淭he long-term goal is to make Australia less likely to oppose China in regional confrontations.鈥?
Australia鈥檚 recent Defense White Paper uses the term 鈥渞ules-based order鈥?over 50 times and strongly dresses down recent Chinese actions without mentioning the nation by name. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, generally something of a Sinophile, mentioned Chinese aggression in his first interview as PM. All of this, and Australia鈥檚 alliance with the US, is carefully watched by Beijing.

The front page of the first liftout (see here) is less concerned with sovereignty than opportunities for trade and the kind of cheerleading for the China Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) one generally hears from the Australian government. It is not dissimilar to the speeches given by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on his recent visit to China, largely to talk up trade and the friendly history between Australia and China.

The ChAFTA has been one of the coups of the current government and took 10 years of negotiations. As Australia鈥檚 mining boom slows the government hopes economic transition will come in the form of exporting agricultural goods and varied services to China. This is still the basis for the relationship with China, even as geostrategic concerns slowly grow.

Wang Hui, deputy editor-in-chief of the Asia-Pacific edition of China Daily, wrote that as ties grow Australians want more information on China. However, 鈥淎ustralian media, as part of the Western media world, have often harbored a bias against developing countries, China included.鈥?Allegations of bias and 鈥榠ncorrect information鈥?are old gripes, but something China has only begun to correct internationally in the past decade.

The South China Morning Post wrote in 2009, 鈥淭he central government is preparing to spend 45 billion yuan (US$6.8 billion at current rates) on the overseas expansion of its main media organizations in an aggressive global drive to improve the country's image internationally.鈥?
Australian broadcasters and newspapers have been dressed down by the Chinese government before. This correspondent reported on an ABC Foreign Correspondent program that Chinese censors tried to have pulled in 2014, given its 鈥渟ensitive鈥?subject matter of the Uighur ethnic group in China. They were not successful.

Australia is not the only country where China Daily is on the charm offensive. During Xi Jinping鈥檚 April trip to Washington, students apparently fanned out across the capital, handing out copies of the China Daily. Some students apparently noted it could be hard to give the papers away.

In the end the question is not so much whether China is now buying up pieces of intellectual real estate in Australia in the form of paid-for newspaper features, but how well this charm offensive works. Dingding Chen suggested not. 鈥淔or cultural diplomacy in general, I think China is doing a poor job unfortunately. So much more can be done, but the system is rigid and only produces low quality stuff.鈥?
Then again, that same 2015 Lowy poll found that most Australians do not know who Xi Jinping is. Should anyone read China Watch they will at least get a fair idea quickly."
"Nigerians Look East to China for Business, Opportunity

LAGOS (AFP) 鈥?Emmanuel Iyayi鈥檚 love of China, its culture and language began early when he watched kung fu films as a child in his native Nigeria. Now 26, that enthusiasm has paid off.

鈥淎ll these generate good money for me. I am happy with the pay I get and this has transformed my life tremendously.鈥?


Iyayi isn鈥檛 alone in being able to reap the benefits of knowing a language that few of his compatriots speak, given Nigeria鈥檚 historic preference for learning European tongues such as French.



Grace Moses teaches and translates Mandarin when she is not studying in her final year at the Confucius institute at the University of Lagos (Unilag).



鈥淚 get a lot of job opportunities from Nigerians who have businesses with Chinese people,鈥?said the 25-year-old, likening herself to a go-between for local and Chinese businesses.



Iyayi and Moses could soon have competition, however, as a new scheme gets under way in Lagos state to teach Mandarin in primary and secondary schools.



The move comes at a time of increased investment by Chinese firms in Nigeria, which is in desperate need of overseas cash because of the fall in global oil revenues on which its economy depends.



Closer ties



On a sunny afternoon at Unilag, Moses 鈥?or Li Minghao as she is also known in class 鈥?sits with a dozen other Nigerian students, most of them women.



Mandarin teacher Fu Yongsheng uses audio-visual aids to teach pronunciation, words and phrases at the institute, set up seven years ago in partnership with the Beijing Institute of Technology.



Fu and seven others also teach Mandarin to some 1,700 primary and secondary students across Nigeria鈥檚 commercial capital.

Yongjin Wang, the director of the institute, said more teachers were needed and is convinced learning Mandarin 鈥渃an help to enhance relations and communications between both countries鈥?



Segun Awonusi, Yongjin鈥檚 Nigerian co-director and a linguistics professor at Unilag, said learning Mandarin makes sense because of the Asian giant鈥檚 economic and political clout.



There are more Mandarin speakers than any other language in the world, making knowledge of the language essential for greater economic and diplomatic cooperation in the future, he added.



鈥淣igeria has also opened a wide market for the Chinese,鈥?added Awonusi.



鈥淭here are efforts to build a generation of Nigerians who can teach Chinese,鈥?he said.



Some three dozen Nigerians are currently studying for language and culture degrees at Chinese universities while a second Confucius institute has been opened in southeast Nigeria.



Lagos has five pilot project schools where Mandarin is taught.



鈥淟earning of Chinese language鈥ims to enhance political and economic ties between Nigeria and those countries,鈥?according to the Lagos state ministry of education.

Nigeria鈥檚 President Muhammadu Buhari visited China recently and came away with a $6 billion pledge to fund much-needed infrastructure projects across the country.



Abuja is looking to deepen economic and political relations with Beijing, building on the $1.79 billion China invested in Nigeria last year.



Trade volume has grown from less than $2 billion at the turn of the century to about $15 billion in 2015, according to government figures.



There are currently more than 200 Chinese companies working in engineering, food, agriculture, railway and road sectors, according to China鈥檚 consul-general, Liu Kan.



China is also present in Nigeria鈥檚 key oil and gas and power sectors, aviation, merchandising, information technology manufacturing, healthcare, textile and transport.



The China Railway Corporation and China Civil Construction Corporation are handling multi-million-dollar railway and road construction in Lagos, Abuja and other cities.



Buhari, however, complained about a large trade imbalance between the two countries in China鈥檚 favour by some 80 percent to 20 percent.



鈥淵ou must not see Nigeria as a consumer market alone but as an investment destination where goods can be manufactured and consumed locally,鈥?he said.



Image problem



Despite its sizeable investment, China has nonetheless room to improve its image in Nigeria, where the country is often associated with the dumping of inferior and even counterfeit products.



Nigeria鈥檚 health authorities have previously said some 70 percent of drugs in Nigeria were fake or adulterated and pointed accusing fingers at imports from China and India.



Customs officials have also repeatedly raided and shut illegal textile importers in Kano and Lagos鈥?China Town, a sprawling shopping complex, over the alleged failure to pay relevant duties.



Initiatives such as the Confucius institute, which is similar to the British Council, Alliance Francaise and Goethe Institute, can help dispel myths and misunderstandings.



鈥淎fter these sanctions, we have held several meetings with Chinese importers and we have intensified our intelligence and monitoring,鈥?Customs spokesman Wale Adeniyi told AFP.

"BEIJING 鈥?On the eve of the approaching Chinese Lunar New Year, the rest of the world is sharing the joy and excitement of the Asian country, a manifestation of the worldwide influence of China鈥檚 most important festival, also known as the Spring Festival.

OCCASION FOR STRENGTHENING TIES

Some national leaders, on the festive occasion, expressed wishes for a stronger bilateral relationship.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday sent her wishes to those celebrating the festival worldwide through the government鈥檚 website, pledging to further develop Britain-China relations, which have a stronger basis than ever before.

鈥淲e receive more Chinese investment than any other major European country. We鈥檝e got around 150,000 Chinese students studying here and the number of Chinese tourists visiting has doubled in five years,鈥?she said.

As 2017 marks the 20th anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to China and the 45th anniversary of the establishment of the ambassadorial relations between Britain and China, May said she hoped both countries will further their ties in various fields.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari also expressed optimism over the strategic partnership between Nigeria and China, noting the two countries had reached a consensus to give full play to corresponding development strategies, strong economic complementarity, and enormous cooperative potential.

The Chinese Lunar New Year celebration emphasized the concept of family and the opportunity of reunion 鈥?values shared by both Nigeria and China, Buhari wrote in a recent statement released by his office.

During a meeting with young Sinologists in Saint Petersburg University, the city鈥檚 Vice Governor Alexander Govorunov said that Russia-China education cooperation has showed a positive trend, with 250 agreements signed between various universities of the two countries.

St. Petersburg needs to expand its knowledge regarding the Chinese language, culture, economics, law and tourism to further relations with China, Govorunov said at the meeting, which was part of a series of month-long cultural events the city hosts in celebrating the Spring Festival.

OCCASION FOR GATHERINGS

During this time of the year, Chinese embassies as well as people of Chinese origin hold various receptions and parties in their respective countries to socialize with their counterparts and friends.

Earlier this month, the Chinese Embassy in Cuba held a New Year鈥檚 reception, welcoming dozens of people of Chinese descent and Cuban guests.

The Chinese Ambassador to Cuba, Chen Xi, assured that the next 12 months will be decisive for strengthening political and commercial ties between the two countries in search of bilateral prosperity, as well as the bonds of friendship that have existed for more than 50 years.

The attendees extended their wishes for good fortune to the Chinese people and the future of bilateral relations.

The Chinese embassies in the United States, Nepal, the Democratic People鈥檚 Republic of Korea, Egypt and Rwanda held all kinds of activities to mark the occasion, attracting members from various circles of their host countries.

President of the French National Assembly Claude Bartolone also threw a party in Paris recently to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year.

OCCASION FOR GALAS

China鈥檚 Spring Festival provides another chance for global revelers to celebrate.

China鈥檚 Zhejiang Traditional Chinese Orchestra and Shaanxi Broadcasting Chinese Orchestra performed in a concert featuring traditional Chinese music at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg on Wednesday.

The concert, which is part of the month-long cultural events in honor of the Chinese Spring Festival in St. Petersburg, proved to be a big success.

However, foreigners were no longer satisfied with being part of the audience of the festive galas, so they took to the stage instead.

What鈥檚 more, over 1,000 Ghanaian students from the capital鈥檚 junior high schools on Wednesday performed Chinese songs and dances to celebrate the Spring Festival.

The event, hosted by the Confucius institute at the University of Ghana Basic Schools, Legon, was attended by officials from the Chinese embassy and Chinese company representatives.

During the event, students from the Confucius institute also displayed their proficiency in spoken Chinese and knowledge of Chinese music, dance and traditional costumes.

Daria Larionova, a 21-year-old Ukrainian student, acted as a co-host of a feast entitled 鈥淭he fate gathered us in Ukraine,鈥?held recently at the Boryspil International Airport in Kiev to greet the Spring Festival.

Dressed in a qipao, a body-hugging traditional Chinese dress, Larionova added to the Lunar New Year鈥檚 atmosphere in the airport, which is decorated with red lanterns, Zodiac-themed paper-cuts and works of Chinese calligraphy.

鈥淚n my opinion, the most entertaining Lunar New Year custom is joint cooking and eating of dumplings. It creates a very friendly atmosphere! It is really great,鈥?Larionova said.

Pummelled by a housing crisis that caused a record-breaking slump last year, some Chinese property developers are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel, but analysts warn the sector is still on course to slow down in the long term.""This is a strong signal that the sector's long-awaited recovery is finally taking root,"" Shehzad Qazi, managing director of China Beige Book, a consultancy firm which tracks the Chinese economy, told AFP.

"When a suspected Chinese spy was extradited to the US last year, the Department of Justice praised the 鈥渟ignificant assistance鈥?given by authorities in Belgium.

Xu Yanjun was arrested in Belgium after going there to meet a contact 鈥渇or the purpose of discussing and receiving the sensitive information he had requested,鈥?according to the US indictment. Xu was charged with attempting to commit economic espionage, with GE Aviation the main target. The case is pending.

Belgium may seem an unlikely destination for a Chinese agent. In fact, it鈥檚 a den of spies, according to domestic intelligence agency State Security (VSSE). It says the number of operatives is at least as high as during the Cold War, and Brussels is their 鈥渃hessboard.鈥?
Host to the European Union鈥檚 institutions and North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters, Belgium is an alluring draw card for aspiring espionage-makers. Diplomats, lawmakers and military officials mingle, sharing gossip and ideas, while Belgium鈥檚 strategic location makes it important to China in its own right as a place to exert influence in Europe.

鈥淭he mere fact that we hold international institutions such as Nato and the EU makes Belgium a natural focus for China,鈥?said Bruno Hellendorff, a research fellow at the Brussels-based Egmont Royal Institute for International Relations. 鈥淚t鈥檚 common knowledge that there are many spies in Brussels, and these days espionage from China is a major and growing concern.鈥?
In February, German newspaper Die Welt cited an unpublished assessment by the EU鈥檚 foreign and diplomatic wing, the European External Action Service, that about 250 Chinese spies were working in Brussels鈥攎ore than from Russia. The Chinese mission to the EU said it was 鈥渄eeply shocked鈥?at the 鈥渦nfounded鈥?reports. 鈥淐hina respects the sovereignty of all countries and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,鈥?it said.

And yet the incidents keep coming. The Chinese director of the Confucius institute at the VUB Brussels University was barred in October from entering the EU鈥檚 passport-free Schengen area for eight years after being accused of espionage, a charge he denies.

An insight into the methods employed by China are outlined in the indictment for Xu, whose duties allegedly included obtaining trade secrets from aviation and aerospace companies in the US 鈥渁nd throughout Europe.鈥?He used aliases and invited experts on paid trips to China to deliver presentations at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, operated by the information ministry. He ensured targets carried a work computer whose data could be captured.

The US remains at the core of Beijing鈥檚 espionage activities鈥攖he head of the FBI said in July that China was trying to 鈥渟teal their way up the economic ladder at our expense.鈥?Yet Europe appears increasingly in focus, with cases of so-called interference by China identified in Poland, France, Germany and the UK.

鈥淭he Chinese are becoming far more active than they were 10 or 20 years ago,鈥?said Charles Parton, a former British diplomat with more than two decades of experience of China.

Espionage is 鈥渢he far end of the spectrum鈥?of interference that ranges from academia to 鈥渢echnological spillover鈥濃€攃ollecting data to send back to China for mining, said Parton, a senior associate fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute.

Belgium鈥檚 elite generally has a relaxed attitude toward China that can open it to charges of complacency. A fractured political system makes it harder to craft a unified strategy鈥攖here鈥檚 still no government six months after elections. A delegation to China this month included four ministers responsible for trade relations: a federal minister plus one each for Dutch-speaking Flanders, Francophone Wallonia and Brussels.

Even as the EU adopts a more skeptical stance toward China鈥攍osing its naivety, as one senior European official put it鈥擝elgium is opening the gates to Chinese investments in strategic areas from energy to shipping and technology. Belgium is responding to China鈥檚 rise 鈥渋n a pragmatic way,鈥?stressing its advantages in areas such as logistics while ensuring 鈥渁ttention to the sustainability of the projects and respect for international standards,鈥?according to the Foreign Ministry.

鈥淭hey have very advanced technologies that China needs,鈥?Wang Yiwei, director of Renmin University鈥檚 Institute of International Affairs and a former Chinese diplomat based in Brussels, said of Belgium鈥檚 appeal. 鈥淭hrough Brussels you can access Europe and even the United States.鈥?He said that Chinese innovation is fast catching up with the US and talk of industrial espionage was exaggerated.

All countries make efforts to win over hearts and minds, and much influence-building is legitimate diplomatic activity. But there鈥檚 also a gray zone and it can be 鈥渄ifficult to tell the hand of the Chinese state from a much more diffuse web of influence-peddling,鈥?the European Council on Foreign Relations said in a 2017 report.

Brecht Vermeulen, who was chairman of the Belgian federal parliament鈥檚 home affairs committee until losing his seat this year, joined the assembly鈥檚 China friendship group soon after his election in 2014 as a lawmaker for the Flemish nationalist N-VA party, the largest group in the then-ruling coalition.

Over the course of his five-year term, Vermeulen made several trips to China, where officials briefed him on technological advances in artificial intelligence, facial recognition and cyber security. During that time, N-VA policy evolved from sympathizing with efforts by some in Taiwan and Hong Kong to keep a distance from China, toward what Vermeulen called Realpolitik.

鈥淚 think we must open more doors to the Chinese and see how they react,鈥?he said in an interview in the Flemish city of Ghent. 鈥淚f they open their doors too, then it鈥檚 good on both sides. Of course we are a small country and China is enormous. But if we act in one way and there鈥檚 a reaction in the same way, then OK, we can proceed, step by step.鈥?
Still, there are signs that Belgian authorities are attuned to potential threats.

In 2016, State Grid Corp. of China, which has more employees than Brussels has inhabitants, bid for a stake in energy company Eandis. A last-minute leak of a VSSE dossier urged 鈥渆xtreme caution,鈥?citing the risk that Belgian technology could be used by the Chinese military, and a planned vote on the bid never took place.

And engaging with China鈥檚 influence apparatus is not without risks. Filip Dewinter, a regional lawmaker with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, was investigated over his ties to an organization suspected of spying for China. The probe was dropped after it was found Dewinter had committed no crime. 鈥淢aybe I had too much faith in these people,鈥?De Morgen newspaper cited him as saying in February, adding he was now 鈥渕ore informed鈥?about Chinese espionage and the need 鈥渢o be careful.鈥?
But while there is now 鈥渟ome strategic thinking鈥?on China in Belgium, the institutional setup means it鈥檚 not across the board, said the Egmont Institute鈥檚 Hellendorff. He sees 鈥渓ittle to no dialogue between regions on the implications of growing Chinese investment in the country, not only in economic terms but also in terms of its impact on values and influence.鈥?
That lack of coordination between regions and layers of government allows the N-VA mayor of Antwerp, Bart de Wever, to play an outsize role in ties with Beijing. Antwerp is home to Europe鈥檚 second-largest port, and has a direct rail link to China.

Renmin University鈥檚 Wang for one thinks bilateral relations are developing well. 鈥淚n Europe there鈥檚 a saying that small is beautiful,鈥?he said. 鈥淏elgium is beautiful in the Chinese understanding.鈥?Bloomberg News"

Several cruise ships now call on the Port of Subic Bay.The CDC said that together with Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), they have been undertaking capacity-building initiatives to address the influx of Chinese tourists and investments.Recognizing China as one of its major markets for tourism and business-related pursuits, it can be recalled that CDC entered in a memorandum of understanding to give better services by fully understanding language and culture.This was signed along with SBMA and University of the Philippines Diliman Confucius institute to train their officers and front line services staff on learning Mandarin language.The conduct of the said training is seen to give better services to foreign tourists to usher in better communication by understanding their culture.

"ANGELES CITY -- In celebration of the Chinese Spring Festival, the University of the Philippines 鈥?Confucius institute (UP-CI) and the City College of Angeles (CCA) staged on Thursday a fashion show highlighting the rich Chinese and Filipino culture, arts, and tapestry.

According to CCA President Dr. Richard Daenos, the event stands as 鈥渁 great opportunity not only to get familiar and promote Filipino culture but also to delve on other cultures as well as a way to build camaraderie, friendship and unity.鈥?
Various collections of traditional to contemporary Chinese and Filipino accessories, costumes and attires were paraded during the fashion show by the finalists of Mr. and Ms. CCA 2018 together with former winners who also brought pride to the college.

The fashion gala also highlighted the creations of Angeles City鈥檚 finest couturier, Rich Sabinian.

鈥淭his is our second year with UP and Xiamen University collaboration and we are excited about where this team up will bring us,鈥?said Dr. Daenos.

The students and guests were also delighted by the back-to-back cultural performance rendered by the CCA Sayaw Angele帽o Dance Troupe and the Tinig Angele帽o choral group.

During her speech, UP-CI Directress Dr. Lourdes Nepomuceno expressed her elation over the success of the CCA and UPCI collaboration.

鈥淚 would want to commend CCA for its unrelenting support in celebrating Chinese Spring Festival with the UP-CI. The extravaganza is one way to propagate the seeds of harmony between the Philippines and China,鈥?Dr. Nepomuceno said.

The UP-CI Directress also urged the students of CCA to take the Mandarin Language course especially now that the UP-CI and the Xiamen University is taking the partnership with CCA to a new level.

鈥淭he UPCI is promoting Chinese language and some of you [the students] are taking Mandarin classes. To date, China needs 100,000 English teachers and if you know how to speak their language, you will have an edge,鈥?Nepomuceno explained.

She also added that the UP-CI is allotting scholarships and grants to students who would pursue graduate studies in Chinese Language.

鈥淵ou will be given scholarships if you want to pursue graduate studies here. You can pursue your master鈥檚 degree in Chinese Language Teaching and everything will be paid for by the government of China,鈥?Nepomuceno furthered.

Mayor Edgardo Pamintuan lauded the CCA and UP-CI administration for the partnership that immersed the CCA students to the rich Filipino-Chinese culture.

鈥淥n a personal note, I am greatly wowed by the accomplishments that our city college has attained over the years. May our partnerships with various academic institutions like UP-CI flourish as we deliver the best quality education that our youth deserves,鈥?he said.

The City College of Angeles will its 6th founding year this February. CCA is also set to introduce the college鈥檚 fourth core value during the opening day of its week-long founding celebration. (PR)"
"ANGELES CITY - To highlight the culture and tradition in China, the Confucius institute of Angeles University Foundation (CI-AUF) celebrated the Mooncake Festival here last October 4 with the participation of Angelenean CI-AUF students and some faculty members.

Wu Jun, Chinese Director of CI-AUF, said that the mooncake festival is annually celebrated in China, every 15th of August.

According to her, it is also called Zhongqiu Jie which means 鈥渕id-autumn.鈥?
The purpose of the event is for Chinese families to reunite and get together, an admiration to the bright and round moon and a beautiful season to drink tea to celebrate the harvest season.

""I think this celebration is relevant for us students who are taking up Chinese Language Class but it is also relevant for other students to celebrate this with us. We want that all the Angeleneans will be able to taste the culture and understand more about China. Actually, when we stayed in China for us to study there, we experienced mooncake festival and Chinese families will invite us to eat with them. This is the moment wherein the moon is very bright and has the perfect round shape. Everyone who is not staying with their family for work or school needs to go back to their family and eat under the bright and beautiful rounded shape moon,"" Monica Jane Torda said, Vice President for Chinese and Cultural Society in CI-AUF, said.

Wang Bolin, a Chinese teacher, said that CI-AUF prepared performances like Beijing Opera, Wu Shu, Kung Fu and other cultural dances in China. Also games like bobing, a luck game and a very popular game during the mooncake festival wherein you will use dice to determine your luck and win mooncake.

Wu said that the event is also a way to let the students know about the importance of the Chinese culture, not only the language.

CI-AUF has been celebrating the mooncake festival at the university for seven consecutive years. (Christian Kier Ronquillo/AUF Intern)"
"Remember when an Australian university had to apologise to its international Chinese students for describing Taiwan as separate country? Or for a lecturer showing a map showing Chinese-claimed territory as part of India?

The Chinese consulate in Australia later got involved, leading to a big debate as to how far overseas universities should or should not tailor to China鈥檚 Communist Party orthodoxy, regardless of how 鈥渙ffensive鈥?it may be to nationalist Chinese students?

Well, a top Australia diplomat has joined the debate. And she鈥檚 taking free speech鈥檚 side.

In a lecture for international students at the University of Adelaide鈥檚 Confucius institute last weekend, Frances Adamson, Australia鈥檚 chief foreign affairs bureaucrat, called for free and respectful debate in university classrooms. Any stifling of free speech by students from all countries will be an 鈥渁ffront to our values鈥?

鈥淣o doubt, there will be times when you encounter things which to you are unusual, unsettling, or perhaps, seem plain wrong,鈥?Adamson said, as reported by Straits Times.

鈥淲hen you do, let me encourage you not to silently withdraw or blindly condemn, but to respectfully engage. The silencing of anyone in our society 鈥?from students to lecturers to politicians 鈥?is an affront to our values.鈥?
The Straits Times noted that the remarks appear to be aimed at China as Adamson鈥檚 statements follow at least four incidents in recent months where Chinese students and diplomats seem to be exerting influence over Australian academia for using teaching material deemed offensive to China.

Education Minister Simon Birmingham yesterday endorsed Adamson鈥檚 remarks, saying students should think critically, according to the BBC.

鈥淓very student should be challenged when they are at university. They should have their thinking challenged, and they should find it a challenging experience.鈥?
Birmingham also called on universities to uphold academic integrity.

鈥淯niversities need to be as ever vigilant today as they have been through their history in terms of ensuring their integrity, their high standing, their delivery of quality education and I am confident that they are doing that, they are challenging the students who come to them, whatever the background of those students,鈥?Birmingham told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Liked this? Then you鈥檒l love these鈥?
Chinese, Indian students just as good as locals for jobs in Australia

"

I tried to maintain a confident stance when I entered the Cebu Daily News building in the middle of an oppressive summer heat of 2006.

I was one of the six Mass Communication students from the University of the Philippines Cebu College assigned to have their print journalism internship in CDN that April.

Upon entering the main door, I immediately noticed the smell of ink and newsprint. The smell made me feel at home. Still, my palms were sweaty when the six of us were led to a conference room and then executive editor Connie Fernandez asked us questions including: 鈥淲hat鈥檚 the difference between a straight news story and a news feature?鈥?
We knew the answer but Connie looked strict and scary that even the most talkative among us was left with no words to answer her questions. One brave lady 鈥?I cannot remember who 鈥?gave an answer that was unsatisfactory to Connie. She was visibly upset. I was shaking from the inside and it made me think if I鈥檓 going to walk out of that internship as a traumatized 19-year-old girl.

I ended up covering the business and economics beat. I did not have a senior reporter to guide me so most of the journalism tips I learned came from Connie and then business editor Irene Sino Cruz. A year later, after college graduation, Connie asked me if I was interested to join the paper as its business and economics reporter. I declined and told her I am more interested to apply for a nongovernment organization.

But Connie was a patient and convincing suitor. She chased me all the way to Leyte (where my family lived then) and talked to my mother convincing her with all passion and brains why I should embrace my calling as a journalist. My mother talked to me that night and ended the conversation with the line: 鈥淔ind a job where you can make use of your skill to inform and inspire people.鈥?
Connie didn鈥檛 have to chase me again after my heartfelt talk with my mother.

My original plan of a monthlong vacation after college graduation was cut short because after two weeks, I packed my bags and reported to the CDN newsroom.

Connie was grinning from ear to ear when she saw me.

鈥淚 told you so,鈥?she said.

Former editor Nestor Ramirez, now professor at the University of San Jose-Recoletos, told me that I won鈥檛 get rich if I honestly do my job as a journalist. But if I want to contribute to society and to nation building, Sir Nestor said this is the perfect job for me.

He also said that I will do better in my future job as a social development professional if I gain experience and expand my network as a journalist.

I am glad I listened to him. (Later in 2011, when I worked as local expert for the Strategic Corporate-Community Partnership for Local Development program of the German Agency for International Cooperation and Philippine Business for Social Progress, I remembered Sir Nestor鈥檚 words and I wanted to give him a high five for that piece of advice.)

I left CDN as a full-time reporter in June 2009 when I started my Chinese studies at the Confucius institute at the Ateneo De Manila University. I got a scholarship from the Gokongwei Brothers Foundation-China Scholarship Program. The same program took me to Fudan University in Shanghai, China, where I embarked in another linguistic and cultural adventure.

When I came home in August 2010, I joined the Philippine Daily Inquirer as a Visayas correspondent upon the encouragement of then Visayas Bureau Chief (now CDN editor-in-chief) Edra Benedicto. I continued to write for CDN even when I moved back to China and the USA when I got married and had children.

A good friend once asked me why I still go back to CDN after all my exposures and experiences in various fields in different countries. My usual answer is: 鈥淚 guess you can never really let go of your first love.鈥?
I have had so many firsts in CDN.

Believe me or not, I was Miss CDN in 2007. I won the Miss Vitaginseng Body Award and finished as first runner-up in the Miss Press Freedom Pageant.

There were only four contestants. But it didn鈥檛 matter.

I had one of the best times of my life that night.

I wore a gown by Ronald Villavelez. Wenwen Zaspa worked magic on my hair and makeup. My chaperone and cheerleader was the loyal Connie while photographer Lito Tecson was there because former publisher Eileen Mangubat said my moment needs to be documented.

Former CDN reporters Suzanne Alueta, Jolene Bolambot, Nilda Gallo, Dale Israel, Mars Alison and Bernadette Parco can attest to the fun that we had while we working together at CDN. The videoke nights, the planned days off, the conversations shared over bottles of beer. My one and only male editor Dennis Singson learned the business jargon and explored the economic landscape with me as we worked on the paper鈥檚 Enterprise page.

Like CDN鈥檚 mascot, Siloy (Cebu Black Shama), I was given the freedom to fly and explore Cebu because I knew Cebu. To embrace siloy as the official mascot of CDN is a very fitting tribute to the paper鈥檚 drive to practice journalism that builds communities. The siloy can only be found in Cebu, nowhere else in the world can you hear it sing its signature melodious song.

In the same manner, the Siloys of CDN are given the task of reporting Cebu, equipped with the values of fairness and accuracy.

Beyond all its garbage and drug problems, the alleged presence of a Korean 鈥渕afia,鈥?savage criminals who prey on children, lechon wars and cyberbullying, CDN is that voice in the middle of a forest that sings the song of truth. It may be quite different from the others and it may not be liked by some, but it is a song that embraces what is essential in a democracy: the kind of journalism that is fair, factual, balanced and takes into account the general welfare of the public.

Every time I enter the CDN building, I always pause to take a deep breath and smell the ink and the newsprint.

I love coming back to the smell of home.

Happy 19th Anniversary, Siloys!

"Taipei 鈥?I鈥檓 home.

We landed at 9:00 p.m. in the landwhere Mandarin Chinese is spoken and I found myself comfortably talking to locals and taxi drivers.

I love this language.

It has a familiar ring and tugs my heartstrings in sound and motion that have always allowed to get in touch with my core.

Back in 2010, I became part of the Gokongwei Brothers China Scholarship program where 40 鈥?and then 37 of us 鈥?studied Chinese Language with lectures on politics, culture and economics at the Confucius institute at the Ateneo De Manila University and Fudan University in Shanghai, China.

That was actually the reason why I left my full-time job as a business and economics reporter of Cebu Daily News to pursue my passion in learning languages.

One year of learning a new language and culture taught me patience and hard work 鈥?and there is no substitute to these values.

Being equipped with a new language capability has helped me navigate the competitive world of social development and international affairs.

It was my love for Mandarin Chinese that led me to Jeff and back to China (Guangzhou) when I got married and had children.

Being in Taipei is like going home to a place you鈥檝e never been. And that is largely because of this language; this language that I haven鈥檛 spoken in the last three years but feels like second nature.

I love hearing people screaming in Chinese, the greasy smell of stinky tofu, the wonderful singsong that fills the air whenever I鈥檓 in the mall.

Language has the ability to connect you to people, cultures and even civilizations.

In learning Mandarin Chinese, I got to know Chinese culture in a deeper sense.

Dongxi (the word for 鈥渢hing鈥? literally means 鈥渆ast鈥?and 鈥渨est鈥?and my Chinese professor said the root of this word signifies the manner by which people travel to buy things in the olden times. 鈥淭hey traveled from east to west,鈥?said the professor.

I will not dare touch on the discussion on Taiwan and mainland China but suffice it is to say that these wonderful places are close to my heart 鈥?and my belly.

Just ask any person who has visited Taipei鈥檚 night markets and China鈥檚 myriad of dimsum spots and tea houses.

The xiaolongbao, commonly known as soup dumplings, is a must-try whether you go to Taiwan or China.

My mother was perplexed when I decided to quit my job to learn a new language.

I never could quite understood it, but I just knew then that I was interested in learning Mandarin Chinese even when I don鈥檛 have a single drop of Chinese blood running in my veins.

Or so I thought.

In a recent trip to Singapore 鈥?another country with a rich Chinese culture 鈥?I talked to an old man while eating at a hawker鈥檚 center.

He told me that I am Chinese and that he could feel it.

He said he could even hear it in my accent.

鈥淭here鈥檚 a mountain called Latou shan in some province in China. You should go there to find yourself and your clan,鈥?he said.

It was like a scene from a Jackie Chan movie because when I came back to the same spot after I got water to quench my thirst, the old man was not there anymore.

I talked to some people when I came back from that trip.

Nellie Chiu, past president of Zonta Club of Cebu I, told me it is really possible that I have Chinese blood because I feel strongly about the culture.

My research brought me to a list of Filipino-Chinese names in Cebu with 鈥淟ato鈥?as a last name.

Looks like I don鈥檛 need to go back to China to find myself or my clan.

Back here in Taipei, Jeff was giving the driver directions on how to get to our hotel. 鈥淵i zhi zou鈥? said Jeff to the driver. That means 鈥淛ust go straight鈥? one of the few phrases that my husband learned from me.

I stepped out of the taxi and was greeted by the receptionist, 鈥淗uanying guanglin ni de jia.鈥?
Yes, welcome to my home indeed.

"Colegio de San Juan de Letran

ADVERTISEMENT

If only the walls of Intramuros could talk and share stories of the past, then the history of Colegio de San Juan de Letran would surely be one interesting tale to hear.

The Colegio was a fusion of two similar institutions, both of which located in the walled City of Intramuros. The first was founded in 1620 by retired Spanish Officer Don Geronimo Guerrero, who transformed his hermitage home into an orphanage called the Colegio de Ni帽os Huerfanos de San Juan de Letran.

It was about the same time when Dominican brother Diego de Santa Maria opened the other institution by the name of Colegio de Huerfanos de San Pedro y San Pablo at the Convent of Sto. Domingo to accommodate young boys under his care while donning a uniform he designed.

Both institutions were created with a purpose to educate and mold orphans into good Christian citizens.

Indeed, the founders of these two institutions with identical origin and purpose did not only share a common concern for the children of Intramuros, but were also linked by the strong bond of friendship.

Thus, it was not at all not surprising that the two institutions were merged into one in 1630 and became known as the Colegio de San Juan de Letran.

The first site was built in 1641 but an earthquake in 1645 destroyed the edifice thus forcing students to temporarily take shelter at the Santo Domingo Convent.

And in 1669, the Dominicans were able to purchase Do帽a Maria Garcia Pinto鈥檚 house and garden which faced the Baluarte de San Gabriel de Dilao.

To this date, the Colegio still stands proudly in that same area and has remained as a silent witness to the numerous hardships and triumphs of individuals who once walked the halls of Letran.

ADVERTISEMENT

Further expansion meanwhile took place in 1894 as The Colegio started to build modern laboratories and an auditorium. More adjustments were made with the arrival of the Americans in 1900.

With a growing population came the need to build a new edifice to meet the standards of that period, and increase its capacity to accommodate the enrollees of Letran.

In 1937, the new Letran building, with elements inspired by the Bauhaus and Art Deco movement of the 1920s and 1930s, was inaugurated under the supervision of Engineer Alberto Guevarra y Sanchez. One of the prominent features of the said building were its iron-wrought window grills and doors and it imposing fa莽ade.

Unfortunately, World War II happened and the building was again damaged, with portions of it heavily burned. It was also during this time when the Japanese Imperial Forces evicted the Dominicans and converted the campus into a garrison. The new building became an unfortunate victim of the Battle of Manila in 1945 but surprisingly it managed to survive and stand the beating.

Letran classes from 1945 to 1946 were again temporarily held at the Domincan Church and Convent in San Juan de Monte just as the Dominicans rebuilt the battered building.

In 1948, the War Damage Commission awarded P795,206.08 to help finance the reconstruction of the Letran building.

And from the 鈥?0s up to the present, Letran further expanded its buildings. Occupying the former Beaterio de Santa Catalina site are the new buildings of Letran while the St. Thomas Hall, St. Albertus Hall, and the Letran Dormitory occupied the former Dominican Compound.

Last year, the new St. Vincent Ferrer Building which was built under the supervision of Carmelo Casas of Casas and Architects, was inaugurated. These new buildings, while reflective of Letran鈥檚 architecture from the 1930s, ushered in a new face for The Colegio with its new floorings, newer classrooms, and facilities.

In a span of almost four centuries, The Colegio managed to produce alumnus who became the builders of the Filipino nation. The names Quezon, Osme帽a, Mabini, Del Pilar, P. Gomez, Balagtas and Aguinaldo, among many others are enshrined in the hearts of every Filipino.

To date these old and new buildings of Letran serves as silent witnesses to Philippine history as prominent men and women continue to walk its halls. Currently Letran is the lone educational institution in Intramuros that still stands proudly in its original historical site.

University of Sto. Tomas

By Ruth L. Navarra

Stepping into the campus of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) is like stepping back in time.

The most recognizable of all the buildings is the Main Building located at the heart of the campus. The cross on top is visible on all sides of the university. It has been designed by Fr. Roque Rua帽o OP and was completed in 1927. It is the first earthquake-resistant building in the country.

It is beautiful inside as it is outside. One can do a Scarlett O鈥橦ara or an Eliza Doolittle at the grand wooden staircase that leads to the Museum. It has two courtyards with grass kept lush and green. It allows air to flow keeping occupants feeling cool even in the hottest summer days.

The building has once been Kilometer Zero of Manila before the point was moved to the Rizal Monument in Luneta Park. Some of its original occupants include the Faculties of Philosophy and Letters, Liberal Arts and Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy. Those faculties have since moved to their own buildings within the campus.

The Renaissance revival-style, four-floor building houses the UST museum, administrative offices, Faculty of Civil Law, and College of Sciences.

The building stays true to its original aesthetics even with updates to cater to modern needs like air conditioning and overhead projectors. Its exteriors serve as canvas for 3D mapping during 鈥淧askuhan,鈥?an annual Christmas festivity.

But the Main Building is not the oldest structure in the university.

That honor belongs to the Arch of Centuries. It stands proudly at the entrance of the Espa帽a gate. The half facing the Main Building came from the ruins of the original arch that once stood in Intramuros since the 1600s.

The half facing Espa帽a Boulevard is a replica of the original arch in Intramuros. The Walled City has once been home to the University before it moved in 1927 to Sampaloc because of its burgeoning student population.

On the pillars of the Arch are plaques honoring two of its most famous alumni Jose Rizal and President Manuel L. Quezon.

Students are welcomed in the university by passing through it during the Freshman Walk. The same students bid farewell to their alma mater four (or more) years later by exiting the Arch during the Baccalaureate Mass.

The Arch鈥檚 stories are not all about history. Students have fun creating urban legends around it. One of the most famous legends is that you will be transported to the Spanish era if you cross it at midnight.

The structures are two of the four National Cultural Treasures declared by National Museum in 2010. The other two are the Open Spaces and the Central Seminary.

The home of the Growling Tigers is one of the newest buildings in the campus. The Quadricentennial Pavilion is glass and steel designed by alumni Jose Pedro Recio and Carmelo Casas. It has been in operation since 2012 and boasts of state-of-the-art facilities that athletes could use.

The university has one of the most picturesque landscapes in the country. Wet or dry, its buildings and grounds stay timelessly beautiful. It is an apt venue where young minds can be nurtured to usher them to a bright future.

Ateneo de Manila University

By Vanessa B. Hidalgo

If only walls could talk, then it would probably tell a rich tale of history about the halls of the Ateneo de Manila University.

Before the Ateneo was located in Loyola Heights, Quezon City, its first building was put up at the corner of Arzobispo and Anda streets in Intramuros, Manila. It was then known as Escuela Municipal de Manila.

It was in Oct. 1, 1859 when the governor-general then authorized the Jesuits to take over a small municipal school for 30 children for Spanish residents. In 1865, the Jesuits turned the Escuela into the Ateneo Municipal de Manila.

After a fire ravaged the Intramuros campus, the Ateneo transferred to Padre Faura in 1932. During the Second World War, a single structure remained and that was the statue of St. Joseph and the Child Jesus. During the liberation of Manila, Ateneo remained open and was temporarily transferred in Plaza Guipit in Sampaloc.

In 1946, the Padre Faura campus reopened with Quonset huts as buildings.

Fr. William Masterson, SJ decided to transfer the school to its present location in Quezon City in 1952. The move to the 83-hectare land in Loyola Heights led to the construction of new buildings to accommodate the growing student population. The Padre Faura served as the professional school until its closure in 1976. Ateneo opened the professional school in Salcedo Village in Makati City the year after.

The year 2000 was an eventful year in the Ateneo grounds. The School of Arts and Sciences, which housed the College and Graduate School, was divided into four buildings. They are the School of Humanities, John Gokongwei School of Management, School of Science and Engineering, and School of Social Sciences. Also, the Moro Lorenzo Sports complex was completed in the same year.

The Manny V. Pangilinan School of Leadership was completed in 2006. In the same year, several projects such as the Ricardo Leong Hall to give way for more units of the School of Social Science, the Confucius institute for Chinese Studies and the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health in Ortigas City.

In 2008, the construction of the Rizal Library commenced. The Library is also home to Ateneo Art Gallery which is widely recognized as the first museum of Philippine modern art. Its collection includes postwar artworks by Filipino artists donated to the University by Fernando Zobel de Ayala.

De La Salle University

By Vanessa B. Hidalgo

The original structure of the De La Salle University was built in the district of Paco, Manila by nine brothers from Europe and the United States on June 16, 1911. It housed 425 students in 1921 until the increase in student population made the brothers decide to move to its present location along Taft Avenue.

During World War II, the building was allowed to remain open because it was located in the outer edge of Manila. It served as a shelter for displaced civilians and wounded soldiers. Although repeated bombings severely damaged the building, classes went on and it even absorbed students from other schools which had been closed down.

Darkness fell in the corridors of the building on Feb. 1, 1945 when Japanese forces ordered the school occupants to vacate the building.

But Egbert Xavier Kelly, then president of the College, refused to do so. He went missing the next day and was never found. On Feb. 12 around noontime, 20 Japanese soldiers came to the campus and massacred 16 brothers who were residing there.

After the liberation of Manila, the school gained its foothold and continued growing since. Now, the DLSU campus has 19 buildings (nine classroom buildings and 10 other buildings) spread across the 5.45 hectares of land.

The St. La Salle Hall is a four-storey neoclassical architecture was the first structure in the campus. Designed by Tommy Mapua, the first Filipino registered Architect who also became the founder of Mapua Institute of Technology. The St. La Salle Hall is known to be 鈥淒LSU鈥檚 most historic building鈥?being the first to house students of the College of Business and Economics. The building is also known to be the only Philippine structure mentioned in the book, 1001 Buildings You Must See Before You die: The World鈥檚 Architectural Masterpieces.

Other buildings included the St. Joseph Hall, which was completed in 1956; Velasco Hall, which houses the College of Engineering; and the Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall, a nine-storey building that has 20 classrooms and six conference rooms.

In 1980, the College of Career Development was established as a night school for working students. It was called the College of St. Benilde in 1988 and became autonomous in 1994. It is located near the DLSU main building.

The Bro. Andrew Gonzales Hall is the tallest academic building in the country. It stands 21-storeys high, has a total area of 28,000 square meters, and has more than 100 classrooms.

On Dec. 2, 2010, construction of the De La Salle Centennial Hall commenced as part of the University鈥檚 Centennial Renewal Plan. The 15-floor building cost P1.4 billion with Henry Sy Sr., chair and founder of SM Corp., donating a total of P300 million to fund the construction. Hence, the building was named after him.

World renowned architectural firm Leandro V. Locsin Partners designed the main concept of the Centennial Hall as a 鈥渉abitable tree in the middle of a forest clearing.鈥?The interiors were designed by Asuncion-Berenguer Inc. It is the only academic structure to receive the Philippines鈥?Berde Standard wherein sustainable design is at the core of the building.

"Drugs, corruption, traffic and crime are dragons that the presidential candidates promise to slay. Lesser monsters seem to be improvements in the economy, government, power generation, disaster preparedness, and environment. Nobody seems to have built a platform on water and culture. Water is set to be our next crisis, with taps in Metro Manila expected to run dry in a decade or two unless a timely solution can be found and implemented by the next administration. Cities need and consume a lot of water but they do not produce it, so where will it be sourced and at what price?

As to culture, it is missing from the agenda of the presidentiables. So when I hear friends in the arts rant about culture being a low priority of the government, I bite my lip to keep from declaring that culture is not a priority, and is not even on the agenda!

ADVERTISEMENT

We are happy that President Aquino found the time to confer the National Artist awards a few months short of his departure from Malaca帽ang. One batch of National Artists was merged with another due to the controversy over additions or 鈥渄agdag鈥?to the laureates who were not even on the shortlist of nominees. I have always maintained that a president is not a rubber stamp, and that the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the Cultural Center of the Philippines, which whittle a long list of nominees and wannabes into a shortlist, must accept that they make recommendations that a president can choose to accept or ignore. A president has the discretion to remove a name from the shortlist but should not add to the list, so Nora Aunor has to wait for another round of screening and a future president who sees fit to elevate her to the Order of National Artists.

Contrary to popular belief, there have been two conferments of National Artist awards under the Aquino administration. That of Fernando Poe Jr. was quietly conferred by President Aquino in 2012. FPJ was posthumously elevated to the Order of National Artist in 2007, but his widow refused to receive the honor from then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo who, she maintains, had stolen the presidency from her husband. The 2007 proclamation was not signed and the award was not conferred, yet FPJ remained in the roster of National Artists. To regularize the situation, President Aquino conferred the award posthumously in 2012.

Another bright spot for culture is the long overdue establishment of the Cultural Diplomacy Unit in our Department of Foreign Affairs, which had been attached to the Office of the Undersecretary for International Economic Relations! It is a first step in institutionalizing the use of culture in our public diplomacy.

One just has to look around Manila to see how culture is utilized by other governments as part of their public diplomacy or 鈥渟oft power.鈥?Some high-profile examples are: the French Alliance Francaise, the Spanish Instituto Cervantes, the German Goethe Institut, the Chinese Confucius institute, the Japan Foundation, and the British Council. The Philippines is not far behind with Sentro Rizal established in a number of our embassies abroad to promote Philippine culture.

With the proper funding, our DFA Cultural Diplomacy Unit can establish an Art in Embassies program like that recently presented by the US Embassy in Manila. Over the years I have been invited to the residences of the French and Spanish ambassadors in Forbes Park and have seen how each new ambassador redecorates the home with art and antiques sent from their home base. Some works were loaned from state museums, so that visitors need not fly to Paris or Madrid to see them. When the French, Spanish and Japanese ambassadors entertain at home without the services of hotel catering, the best in dinnerware and flatware from their countries can be enjoyed.

US Ambassador Philip Goldberg hosted a reception at his residence in Forbes Park this week for an Art in Embassies exhibition that brought to Manila works that connected our countries. Previous ambassadors brought American art that is part of a global visual arts program run by the US Department of State Office of Art in embassies since 1963. These works of art, chosen in consultation with the ambassador, 鈥渁llow foreign citizens, many of whom might never travel to the US to personally experience the depth and breadth of our artistic heritage and values鈥?making

what has been called a 鈥榝ootprint that can be left where people have no opportunity to see American art.鈥欌€?
Of the works on display, I liked those of Leo Abaya most because these were rooted in our history. 鈥淭his can happen elsewhere鈥?(2004) is an image drawn from the late-16th-century Boxer Codex installed directly on the wall in one of the rooms of the embassy. It shows a man decorated in gold like a Christmas tree, which should make our generation ask, If our 16th-century ancestors were so rich, why are we so poor today? 鈥淣egotiating space鈥?(2005) uses an image of a smiling enemy soldier during the Filipino-American War. Then there is a portrait of Rizal by Jeff Huntington that needs little or no explanation.

I left the US Embassy hoping that the next administration will provide a budget for a similar program where Philippine Embassies abroad can provide foreigners a chance to know and experience our art and culture as a means of public diplomacy.

"BAGUIO CITY鈥擵olunteer teachers from the Confucius institute entertained the community here on Feb. 9 by performing segments of the Peking Opera during the city鈥檚 Spring Festival celebration.

The institute has deployed a virtual army of teachers around the world to teach the Chinese language and share their heritage in select senior high schools under the K-12 Basic Education Program.

ADVERTISEMENT

The teachers donned period costumes, performed acrobatic tricks and sang operatic Mandarin tunes.

Mandarin is included in the foreign language course鈥攐ne of the specialized core courses鈥攐f the new senior high school program.

According to the government鈥檚 K-12 program website, the senior high school program is two years of specialized upper secondary education.

鈥淪tudents may choose a specialization based on aptitude, interests and school capacity. The choice of career track (academic; technical-vocational-livelihood; and sports and arts)鈥?will define the content of the subjects a student will take in Grades 11 and 12,鈥?the website said.

Chen Yanyi, a member of the visiting teachers鈥?group, said the volunteers were here to scout for universities that would partner with the institute.

Chen said the volunteer teachers faced a huge task.

鈥淢ost Filipinos only know the words, 鈥榮iomai鈥?and 鈥榮iopao鈥?so we want to share more of our culture,鈥?she said.

Not a centavo spent

Zhang Shifang, a teacher, said 76 Chinese volunteer teachers had been deployed to different schools all over the country.

ADVERTISEMENT

These schools do not spend a centavo for the volunteers, who are paid by the Chinese government, she said.

The institute also trains Filipino scholars. The first batch of graduates of the Mandarin course at the Fujian Normal University in 2010 included Cavin Pamintuan, a Filipino language teacher.

The reformed K-12 curriculum will soon be part of the web service offered for free by the London-based education technology company, Quipper, in areas such as Bontoc town in Mt. Province.

Quipper serves as a supplementary teaching aid. The service allows teachers free access to hundreds of lessons and test quizzes on English, Math and Science.

Teachers can assign lessons and tests to their students online while students can go through tutorials on their computers and mobile devices.

In November, a Quipper school was launched in Bontoc despite the weak Internet signal there, said Gloria Buya-ao, Mt. Province schools division superintendent.

Quipper country manager Yuki Naotori said the company was preparing to incorporate the K-12 program syllabus for school year 2016-17 in the website鈥檚 contents.

Specialized courses

The K-12 reforms may also produce new specialized courses at the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) soon to suit the demands of the Armed Forces service units like the Army, Air Force and Navy, said Maj. Gen. Oscar Lopez, former PMA superintendent.

Lopez relinquished his post to Maj. Gen. Donato San Juan II in a Feb. 13 ceremony. He was praised by Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Hernando Iriberri for studying 鈥渢he impact of [K-12 reforms] on the PMA resulting in鈥?[the] rewriting [of] the curriculum and recruitment system.鈥?
Lopez said the PMA curriculum lost its general education subjects to Grades 11 and 12 under the reformed basic education law.

鈥淲e are still conducting consultations and we have tapped the expertise of the University of the Philippines. A technical working committee will have to determine if we need additional majors or technical subjects,鈥?he said. Kimberlie Quitasol, EV Espiritu and Jessica Tabilin, Inquirer Northern Luzon

"A wave of protests swept the Net when it was revealed that the Filipino film 鈥淥ne More Try,鈥?which won best picture at the Metro Manila Film Festival last December, bore a striking resemblance to the Chinese Berlin fest winner, 鈥淚n Love We Trust.鈥?
鈥淚n Love We Trust鈥?was shown in Manila three years ago during the annual Spring Film Festival, whose organizers this year seem unruffled by the comparison.

Sidney Christopher Bata, director of Ateneo de Manila University鈥檚 Ricardo Leong Center for Chinese Studies, told Inquirer that he鈥檇 rather focus on the positive.

The Spring Fest, now on its seventh year, runs at the Shangri-La Plaza mall from today till Feb. 10. The event is undertaken by the Leong Center, the Confucius institute and Credit Suisse.

Good sign

Bata sees the near-controversy as a good sign. 鈥淲e鈥檙e happy that Chinese cinema is able to inspire local filmmakers,鈥?he said, expressing hope that the discussions would increase Filipinos鈥?interest in Chinese films and future editions of the festival. He jested, 鈥淚nstead of just 鈥極ne More Try,鈥?[let there be] 鈥楳ore and More Tries.鈥欌€?
The festival鈥檚 goal is to promote Chinese language, culture and cinema in mainstream Philippine society. Bata announced that the Ricardo Leong center was in the proces of adapting a Chinese literary work as a Filipino-language play to be staged in the third quarter of this year.

Collaboration

For this year鈥檚 edition of Spring Fest, organizers have teamed up with the Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP), through its Film Cultural Exchange Program.

The council helped the organizers secure necessary permits to screen their entire lineup of six films without having to pass through the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB).

The films鈥攖hree of which are award-winning鈥攎et the criteria set in the exemption memorandum between the FDCP and MTRCB.

Best effects

鈥淧iano in a Factory鈥?won in festivals in Tokyo (2011, best actor for Wang Qian-Yuan), Sydney (2011, special jury prize) and Shaoxing, China (Golden Flower Movie Festival, best original film music).

鈥淪torm Warriors鈥?won for best visual effects in the Hong Kong Film Awards.

鈥淛asmine Women鈥?won the grand jury prize in the Shanghai fest and best actress in China鈥檚 Golden Rooster Awards (for Zhang Ziyi).

The three other films on the list are 鈥淪pace Dream,鈥?鈥淕olden Times鈥?and 鈥? Become 1.鈥?Bata pointed out that all the movies tell universal stories.

鈥淪pace Dream鈥?is about a man whose persistence earns him his family鈥檚 love and respect. 鈥淕olden Times鈥?focuses on the children of migrant workers. 鈥? Become 1鈥?espouses the cause of breast-cancer awareness.

FDCP screenings

鈥淭he FDCP will also screen all six films in its Cinematheques all over the country,鈥?said Bata.

Last year, the Spring Fest attracted 12,000 viewers. 鈥淭his year,鈥?Bata said, 鈥渨e are targeting 20,000. With FDCP and our school partners in Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and Cagayan de Oro, we hope to achieve that. But our biggest dream is to have an annual Filipino film festival in China, too.鈥?

"In under four hours, we had: 1) crawled into a small-scale mine in Nueva Vizcaya with 13-year-old Ongan and followed him around till he held a speck of raw gold in his palm, fruit of his day-long labor; 2) witnessed the grueling life of Bobby, a fisherman/padyak tricycle driver; 3) took in some opera classics as performed by Tsinoy singers; 4) sang along with high school students as the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra played Eraserheads hits; 5) and marveled at a verbal joust in verse.

And we were there the whole day.

The documentaries 鈥淏alitok (Gold)鈥?by Sheryl Rose Andes and 鈥淧amutok (Caught in a Net)鈥?by Godson Escopete; the mini opera, PPO mini-concert and the Balagtasan were just five of over a hundred performances offered at the Cultural Center of the Philippines鈥?annual buffet, 鈥淧asinaya鈥?on Feb. 3.

As in the previous eight years, thousands of students, teachers and art (dance, music, theater, cinema, literature) enthusiasts both local and foreign flocked to the event. The head count fell just a little short of last year鈥檚 50,000: to be exact, 42,932, according to CCP officials.

鈥淧asinaya 2013鈥?showcased Filipino-Chinese arts and culture鈥攊n collaboration with Kaisa para sa Kaunlaran Foundation Inc. and Bahay Tsinoy Museum. Next year, the CCP will work with the Manila and Pasay City local governments for the 10th edition, according artistic director Chris Millado.

鈥淲e will involve museums and other cultural institutions along Roxas Boulevard,鈥?Millado told the Philippine Daily Inquirer.

Pasinaya literally means 鈥渋nauguration鈥?or preview. As such, the annual celebration offers a glimpse of the center鈥檚 resident companies, said CCP president Raul Sunico.

The event featured some 3,000 artists from 300 participating groups in over 100 shows and activities.

鈥淲e started preparing in December,鈥?said Bahay Tsinoy director Mean Ang See. She was 鈥渆specially proud鈥?of Comida Tsina, a Tsinoy food fair. 鈥淓ach food stall had 鈥渁 curatorial statement on what the food is about and what makes it Filipino-Chinese,鈥?Millado noted.

All for P50

The 鈥淧asinaya鈥?parade, which began at 8 a.m., was led by CCP resident companies: Ballet Philippines, Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company, Philippine Ballet Theater, Philippine Madrigal Singers, Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra, Tanghalang Pilipino and the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group.

Also represented were the UST Symphony Orchestra, Dulaang Ganap, Higantes of Angono, Kalipi Performing Arts Group, Ling Nam Athletic Federation, Marikina Dance Guild, Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, Ming Sheng Wushu Association, Nayong Pilipino Dance Company, Philippine Buddhacare Academy, Samahang Nazareno, Supervoice Music, Tanghalang Ateneo, Teatro Baguntao, Teatro Dingal and the National Music Competition for Young Artists.

All these groups were to give performances throughout the day. To watch them and any or all of the other offerings, spectators paid a minimum sum of P50 at the gates (P300 donations were welcome, too).

Exhibits featured Chinese medicine and horoscope reading. In smaller venues, like the CCP library, were held poetry reading and story-telling activities.

Seems every nook and cranny at the CCP was utilized鈥?theaters, lobbies, hallways, promenade areas, even the outside ramps.

Documentaries from last year鈥檚 Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival were screened one after another to enthusiastic young groups who didn鈥檛 mind queuing up for every title.

To illustrate life in the old Parian of Intramuros, the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group鈥?taking the Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo (Main Theater) stage鈥攗sed colorful traditional Filipino costumes. And instead of traditional Chinese music, Filipino instruments like bandurias and octavinas accompanied the dancers.

An excerpt from the coming musical play 鈥淚balong鈥?was presented on the same stage a while later. Jenine Desiderio, in a sleek serpentine costume, roused the crowd with her powerful voice. Absolute scene stealers were the animal outfits donned by the rest of the cast, the most arresting of which was that of a wild boar鈥檚 head.

Adapted for stage by Rody Vera and mounted by Tanghalang Pilipino, 鈥淚balong鈥?is based on Filipino folk legends.

Ballet Philippines鈥?performed an excerpt of their coming presentation of Shakespeare鈥檚 鈥淎 Midsummer鈥檚 Night Dream.鈥?
At the Bulwagang Fernando Amorsolo on the fourth level, the Ateneo de Manila Confucius institute conducted Chinese game demonstrations and a calligraphy workshop.

Calligraphy master Zhou Baofa described the Chinese written art to his select audience as a performance art. Baofa has been practicing this art for almost 30 years.

Speaking in Chinese, he told the audience that, on top of pushing one鈥檚 creativity to the limit, calligraphy enhances the spirit and one鈥檚 physical well-being, like the practice of tai chi.

鈥淭o embrace the art of calligraphy,鈥?the master said, 鈥渙ne must use the body to imitate the Chinese characters that will appear on paper.鈥?
Another workshop, conducted by Bahay Tsinoy, taught participants how to create the type of lanterns used for the Chinese Spring Festival, held on the 15th day after the Chinese New Year.

Unlike the colorful Christmas parol made in Pampanga, the Chinese lanterns utilize recycled ang pao (little red envelopes), yarn and beads.

After lantern-making, the festival-goers enjoyed a session of bi-pao, or Chinese jackstones.

The storytelling session at the library ended in a Balagtasan with young poet Ralph Fonte and veterans Vim Nadera Jr. and Mike Corroza.

Before sunset, a street performance by Ukelele Underground Philippines, a motley group of enthusiasts, attracted a bemused crowd, some of whom happ

ily joined in with their own ukes.

At 6 p.m., 鈥淧eople鈥檚 Gala,鈥?culmination of the day鈥檚 event, filled Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo to its 1,500 capacity.

The gala consisted of more performances鈥攂y the Philippine Cultural College Folk Dance Troupe, E-Dance Theater Performing Arts Lab Inc., Spotlight Artists Center, Sherwin Gozon, Elaine Lee, Joanna Go, Rogelio Saldo Chua, Jonathan Coo, Eva Marie Poon, Richard Poon and Margaret Jade Chualao, among others.

In his thank-you address, Millado said: 鈥溾€楶asinaya鈥?is a great opportunity to show the whole world how brilliant and creative Filipinos are. We hope to see all of you in future shows at the CCP.鈥?

"It鈥檚 the biggest edition of the Spring Film Festival, now on its sixth year at the Shangri-La Plaza mall, according to its organizers.

The audience for the annual film event鈥攚hich showcases award-winning and popular films to usher in the Chinese New Year鈥攈as grown steadily through the years, said Rosita Leong, founder of Ateneo de Manila University鈥檚 Ricardo Leong Center for Chinese Studies, one of the fest鈥檚 organizers, along with the Confucius institute.

Last year, Shangri-La鈥檚 291-seat Cinema 4 boasted 95-percent attendance in almost all screenings of the four movies in the weeklong fest, said Marline Dualan, the mall鈥檚 division manager for marketing.

Six movies

On its sixth year, the fest will screen six movies (鈥淥cean Heaven,鈥?鈥淟ost on Journey,鈥?鈥淐ountry Wedding,鈥?鈥淐onfucius,鈥?鈥淏odyguards and Assassins,鈥?鈥淜ing of Milu Deer鈥? in 10 days, from January 20 to 29.

There will be simultaneous free screenings in Visayas and Mindanao鈥攁t the Sacred Heart School in Cebu starting tomorrow until January 22, and at Ateneo de Davao from Jan. 24 to 25.

All screenings are for free.

鈥淲e鈥檝e teamed up with the Chinese Embassy in Manila,鈥?said Sidney Bata, director of the Ricardo Leong Center.

The embassy gave the organizers a list of films, eventually narrowed down to the six, that highlight the diversity of contemporary Chinese cinema. Three films top-bill China鈥檚 biggest stars: Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat and Leon Lai.

In 鈥淥cean Heaven,鈥?Li plays the dying father of an autistic child.

Chow portrays the Chinese philosopher Confucius in the bio-pic which shows the icon鈥檚 human side.

Lai leads the all-star-cast epic 鈥淏odyguards and Assassins,鈥?which also features Donnie Yen, Nicholas Tse, Jacky Cheung, Eric Tsang, Fan Bingbing and Wang Bo-Chieh.

鈥淟ost on Journey,鈥?Bata explained, is quite timely as it is set during the New Year holidays which witness the biggest annual human migration when millions of Chinese return to their hometowns. The comic road movie is about friendship.

Adding a touch of romance is 鈥淐ountry Wedding,鈥?which shows the differences (and similarities) among urban and rural folks as they prepare for a momentous family occasion.

Also noteworthy is the inclusion of a 3-D animated film, 鈥淜ing of Milu Deer,鈥?which sheds light on environmental concerns.

Proceedings at the sitting of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) have been suspended again.

David Monyae, Co-director of the Confucius institute and political analyst

There are a number of factors at play. You have your generational demands for reforms within African institutions such as PAP. We also see the corruption that is deepening where members of parliament at PAP turn to care about their own wellbeing and hold on to leadership above the needs of the people on the ground that they represent. David Monyae, Co-director of the Confucius institute and political analyst

READ: Mathole Motshekga: We can't allow a few colonised minds to dictate future of PAP

This is one of the most important institutions that we should be building. The AU (African Union) has its own organs, its own institutions and one of those institutions is the parliament that is supposedly people-driven. However, it has been a matter of people representing their heads of state and their parliaments, instead of being elected from the ground and representing the interests of the people. David Monyae, Co-director of the Confucius institute and political analyst

You have that kind of elitist establishment of these institutions where they follow their own interests and this is compounded by the interests of external forces, external powers. and the language used is an excuse for corruption. David Monyae, Co-director of the Confucius institute and political analyst

It is sad that at a time when we are expecting voices coming from the most important institutions such as PAP, they take a break to discuss an issue that shouldn't be an issue in the first place. This calls for African states and African people to demand change at the AU as well as the African parliament itself to ensure that there is a clear financial audit, to see how it is managed and also to change the kind of people that represent countries. David Monyae, Co-director of the Confucius institute and political analyst

There should be some way of scrutinising whether these people are mature enough, they are not corruptible. David Monyae, Co-director of the Confucius institute and political analyst

"The Sino-Africa relationship has blossomed to the point where China has become almost omnipresent in Africa. But the relationship between the two parties was not an overnight event. It was forged during the heady days of the 1960s and 70s anti-colonial struggles in Africa when China lent moral and material support to a number of liberation movements in countries such as Algeria, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

China鈥檚 role in the liberation struggles in various African countries remains a key source of legitimacy for the Sino-African relationship 鈥?at least in the eyes of the African leaders. One of the liberation movements to benefit from China鈥檚 sympathy and support was the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu). China provided Zanu鈥檚 military wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (Zanla), with ideological support, material assistance and military training in the 1960s when the liberation movement in Zimbabwe decided to take up arms against the white minority regime.

The current Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa is reported to have led the first five Zanu members sent to China in 1963 for six months鈥?military training. Even the iconic Zanla commander, Josiah Magama Tongogara, was trained in mobilising the masses, military strategy and tactics at the Nanjing Academy in Beijing in 1966.

China also sent military instructors from the People鈥檚 Liberation Army (PLA) to train Zanla soldiers in Mgagao training camp in Tanzania. It was from these encounters that Mao Zedong鈥檚 guerilla tactics, the importance of peasant mobilisation and concepts such as 鈥減eople鈥檚 army鈥?and 鈥減eople鈥檚 war鈥?were drilled into Zanu cadres. China鈥檚 decision to assist Zanu was not entirely altruistic, but was partly motivated by the need to find its footing in southern Africa to contain the Soviet influence during the Sino-Soviet conflict of the 1960s. It paid off handsomely for China as Zanu鈥檚 armed struggle helped force the white minority government to accept democratic elections. Zanu-PF went on to win the elections in 1980 and assumed power in Zimbabwe, marking the demise of colonial rule.

When it assumed power at the end of white minority rule in April 1980, diplomatic relations were promptly established between the two countries, beginning the first phase of the post-independence China-Zimbabwe relationship.

Blessing-Miles Tendi, in his book The Army and Politics in Zimbabwe, described the bilateral ties between China and Zimbabwe as 鈥渨eakened without friction鈥?in the first two decades of independence (1980-2000). This period saw exchanges of high-level visits with the late former president Robert Mugabe visiting China not less than six times. Zimbabwe received then Chinese premier Zhao Ziyang in 1983 and former president Jiang Zemin in 1996 among other high-level officials from China.

As gestures of friendship, China built Zimbabwe鈥檚 National Sports Stadium in the 1980s and also extended a modest amount of loans ($26-million in 1980, $33-million in 1983, $25-million in 1987 and $9.8-million in 1993) to aid development in the newly independent country. However, these loans paled into insignificance compared with the loans sourced from the West (World Bank, $417.3-million; the European Economic Community, $156-million; and Sweden, $204-million).

Hence, while having helped usher in independence, China played a rather subdued economic role in the first 20 years of post-colonial rule in Zimbabwe.

China had just emerged from the Mao era in the late 1970s and entered into the reform era led by Deng Xiaoping during which ideology took a back seat in its relations with other countries. However, the Chinese Communist Party鈥檚 (CPC) ideological influence during the liberation was visible in Zimbabwe鈥檚 first post-independence leader Robert Mugabe鈥檚 Marxist-Leninist rhetoric, even though he applied it to a limited extent policy-wise. Zanu-PF鈥檚 strong countryside support, its desire for a one-party state and heavy-handed suppression of dissent were perhaps some of the enduring elements imparted by the CPC cadres that shaped Zanu-PF鈥檚 approach to governance.

It would take the coincidence of China鈥檚 鈥淕oing Out鈥?policy in the late 1990s and a dramatic turn of events in Zimbabwe to usher in the second phase of the relationship between the two countries.

By 2002, in the aftermath of the controversial Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP), Zimbabwe was completely isolated by the West and had been slapped with targeted economic and political sanctions by the European Union (EU), Australia, Canada and the United States. The sanctions were based on allegations of human rights abuses perpetrated by the government of Zimbabwe.

The country was also suspended from the Bretton Woods Institutions 鈥?the World Bank in 2000 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2003 鈥?for failing to pay the arrears to its debts. Failing to access credit lines from the Bretton Woods Institutions and nursing a decimated agricultural sector, Zimbabwe plunged into a catastrophic economic decline which saw its gross domestic product shrink by almost 50% by 2008.

It was in this grim situation that Zimbabwe announced the 鈥淟ook East Policy鈥?(LEP) in 2003, aiming to cultivate close relations with East Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, India, Indonesia and especially China for economic and diplomatic salvation.

In his 2005 Independence Day speech at the National Sports Stadium in the capital Harare, Robert Mugabe was quoted as saying 鈥渨e have turned east where the sun rises and given our backs to the west where the sun sets鈥? He said this as 鈥渘ewly acquired Chinese jet fighters screamed over the Chinese-built stadium to emphasise his policy of friendship with Asian powers鈥? Mugabe reminisced how China stood with Zanu-PF during the liberation struggle, suggesting that China was a genuine friend, unlike the West.

China wasted no time in filling the vacuum left by the West in Zimbabwe. The Chinese have since penetrated almost every economic sector in Zimbabwe including mining, energy, real estate, transport, tourism, agriculture, telecommunications and media. There are more than 80 state-owned Chinese enterprises operating in Zimbabwe.

According to the Global Investment Tracker published by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), China amassed a total of $10.45-billion in investments and contracts in Zimbabwe between 2005 and 2020. With almost $3-billion in loan commitments to Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2018, China has become Zimbabwe鈥檚 biggest lender.

Some of the largest investment projects China has bankrolled in Zimbabwe include the Hwange Thermal Power Plant ($1.2-billion), Kariba South Hydropower project ($320-million) and $219-million for the upgrade of state-owned mobile telecom NetOne.

Between 2000 and 2014, Zimbabwe was the second-highest recipient of Chinese Official Development Assistance (ODA) across Sub-Saharan Africa with a total of 71 (5.4%) of social, production and economic projects worth $1.79-billion. Among other manifestations of close ties include China鈥檚 construction of the $98-million National Defence College in 2013, Chinese company Shanghai Construction Group building a new $140-million parliament complex and the awarding of the largest diamond concessions to two Chinese companies, Anjin and Jinan, in Zimbabwe鈥檚 Marange diamonds fields in 2011.

Zimbabwe and China also cooperate on a cultural level. In 2006, the University of Zimbabwe launched the Confucius institute of Zimbabwe funded by the Chinese Ministry of Education in a bid to promote Chinese culture and language in Zimbabwe. The Institute offers a six-level course in Chinese languages and has seen more than 5,000 students enrol and produced more than 2,000 graduates since 2007.

Zimbabwe and China have also strengthened educational ties. A Chinese company, the Hengshun Zhongsheng Group, has been funding the Zimbabwean Presidential Scholarship Programme to send 50 students every year to study in Chinese universities.

At a geopolitical level, China vetoed the resolution of the UN Security Council sanctions on Zimbabwe in 2007 that had been supported by the US, Britain and France. Although China has stressed its principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, Zanu-PF and the CPC still maintain relations at a party-to-party level. Zanu-PF leaders frequently visit China for workshops on party building and economic development.

Thus, the China-Zimbabwe relationship, itself a microcosm of the broader China-Africa relationship, is strongly rooted in the bonds created during the anti-colonial struggle. Liberation movements have played an instrumental role in facilitating and promoting China-Africa relations.

The CPC鈥檚 investment in liberation movements when they had nothing to offer has today yielded multiple returns for China in the form of geopolitical support at the global level and access to Africa鈥檚 abundant natural resources. In retrospect, as the CPC celebrates 100 years of existence in July 2021, its alignment with the decolonisation movement may have been one of its best decisions. DM"

"As South Africa awaits an announcement on the timing of Jacob Zuma stepping down as president of the country, questions will once again be raised as to what benefits and special rights he will be entitled to receive as a former head of state.

Many believe Zuma鈥檚 departure is imminent following the SONA postponement 鈥?and indeed new president of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement on Wednesday: 鈥淲e will be able to communicate further on president Zuma鈥檚 position as president of the Republic once we have finalised all pertinent matters.

鈥淚 am aware that the uncertainty surrounding the position of the Head of State and Government is a cause for concern among many South Africans. This is understandable,鈥?Ramaphosa said.

Speaking to BusinessTech, Dr David Monyae a politics expert and co-director of the Confucius institute at the University of Johannesburg said that the ANC would need to tread carefully in how it plans to deal with Zuma鈥檚 exit as it would almost certainly set a precedent for future South African politics.

鈥淚 think what we are seeing are the effects of a Constitutional democracy,鈥?said Monyae.

鈥淲hile it can be very easy to say that politically he must go, they (ANC) don鈥檛 want to create a precedent for how similar events may unfold in the future. They will have to act not only in their own interests but in the best interests of the country,鈥?he said.

Monyae said that a similar principal would have to be applied to any benefits that the president receives should he announce his resignation.

鈥淗e would be a citizen like you and I, and should he commit a crime he should not be seen to be above the law,鈥?said Monyae.

鈥淏ased on what we know surrounding the alleged corruption and his proposed resignation, I would like to believe that the same standards will be be held in that regard,鈥?he said.

There are some benefits that Zuma can expect that are given to all former state presidents in South Africa, said Monyae.

These include:

Personal security for himself, wife and his immediate family. This will include physical security such as bodyguards as well as a motorcade based on an assessment of his security requirements. However the security details will be notably smaller than what he is currently afforded.

A home which the State contributes to fully or partially 鈥?based on Zuma鈥檚 security requirements.

Health insurance, including treatment at military hospitals, as well as the care and respect one would typically give to a former head of state.

A mandated salary ( approved at R2.87 million in 2016) with any increases as stipulated in government gazettes.

NEWS ANALYSIS

When the severity of the coronavirus pandemic became apparent in Nigeria, the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation offered a helping hand. The company, which is responsible for constructing railways across Nigeria, said it would import and pay for 1.3-million medical masks, more than 100 000 sets of personal protective equipment and 50 medical ventilators. It also promised to sponsor 18 medical specialists from China.

Nigeria鈥檚 government welcomed the company鈥檚 initiative with open arms. Nigerian doctors were not so keen.

In a statement in early April, the Nigerian Medical Association said although it welcomed the supplies donated by the Chinese company, it was 鈥渁 thing of embarrassment鈥?that the specialists were invited without due consultation, and linked a spike in cases in Italy to the arrival of Chinese doctors there.

This was a minor diplomatic incident, overshadowed by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma鈥檚 high-profile donations of medical equipment to African countries. Since then, however the headlines have been getting worse 鈥?at least as far as Beijing is concerned.

The Guangzhou videos

China鈥檚 relationship with Africa, so often regarded as the continent鈥檚 definitive foreign policy alliance of the past few years, ebbed to perhaps its lowest point in the public sphere after videos and images depicting the maltreatment of African citizens by Chinese security officials in the city of Guangzhou emerged on social media.

Amid China鈥檚 increased focus on a second wave of coronavirus cases being potentially imported from abroad, many African citizens in the southern city said they were racially profiled by security agents. There were reports of forced evictions, repeated testing without evidence of a travel history and being refused services in hotels and other establishments.

Tony Mathias, an 24-year-old exchange student who was forced from his apartment, told AFP: 鈥淚鈥檝e been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat 鈥?I cannot buy food anywhere, no shops or restaurants will serve me 鈥?We鈥檙e like beggars on the street.鈥?
Guangzhou has long hosted the highest number of Africans in China, with an estimated 320 000 entering or leaving the country through the city. Accusations of racism towards Africans there are nothing new, says Ilaria Carrozza, project coordinator at Oslo鈥檚 Peace Research Institute who studies China-Africa relations. But the backlash against China was amplified due to African leaders raising their concerns 鈥渆xplicitly and bluntly鈥? she says.

Social media played a role in exacerbating the scandal. There has been a recent influx of Chinese government officials abroad who have joined social media, particularly Twitter, even as these mediums remain banned at home. Carrozza says this embrace of social media may have inadvertently prompted the quick rebuttal they faced from African leaders.

鈥淭he more the Chinese leadership diversifies the media platforms it utilises to push its official narrative, the more it will inevitably be exposed to more scrutiny, even from within countries that are typically more likely to express favourable views of the country,鈥?said Carrozza.

African politicians in Nigeria, Uganda and the African Union鈥檚 Addis Ababa headquarters quickly called in Chinese ambassadors to explain themselves. And they made sure to document these visits for their citizens to see. There was even a video of Nigeria鈥檚 speaker of the lower house of Parliament, Femi Gbajabiamila, giving a stern talking-to to the Chinese ambassador in Abuja.

Eric Olander, managing editor of The China Africa Project website and co-host of the China in Africa podcast, says social media played a huge part in how African leaders reacted. 鈥淲e saw the raw power of social media that forced African leaders into action much faster than they probably would have reacted before.鈥?
And Judd Devermont, director of the Africa programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), believes: 鈥淎frican leaders are setting new boundaries with their Chinese counterparts 鈥?African rebukes of the Chinese are rarely as forceful or public. African ties to China will remain close, but it may presage some shifts in behavior and tone.鈥?
Those close ties have come under increased scrutiny from African citizens in light of recent events. Many took to social media to demand the deportation of Chinese nationals on the continent and called for the untangling of the numerous economic relationships between China and African countries. But that is unlikely. 鈥淭here are too many interests at stake in the China-Africa relationship for that to happen, being these economic or otherwise,鈥?Carrozza said.

China鈥檚 African footprint

China has become influential on the continent over the past two decades and the influence has only deepened significantly since President Xi Jinping assumed office. His flagship Belt and Road Initiative has seen China loan money to African countries to build infrastructure projects like airports, stadiums and skyscrapers. More than $143-billion has been disbursed in loans since 2000, according to the John Hopkins SAIS China-Africa Research Initiative.

The influence is not limited to loans, as China continues to expand its cultural footprint through the spread of the Confucius institute, a nonprofit organisation, promoting Chinese culture and language around the world. It has 48 centres in Africa; only France has more cultural institutes on the continent. Schools in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa are introducing Mandarin lessons for their pupils.

While Africa is perhaps too deep in its relations with China to contemplate a pullback, Carrozza says this episode should make the continent鈥檚 leaders fight for better treatment of their citizens in China.

鈥淭his should be taken as an opportunity to be pursued especially by African leaders, to always demand fairer treatment for their citizens, rather than letting these concerns be exclusively driven by the events of the day,鈥?she said.

Experts agree the flare-up in Guangzhou is highly unlikely to alter the course of China-Africa relations, but Olander says there has been a subtle shift in China鈥檚 priorities on the continent before the incident anyway. Most of what Africa sells to China such as timber, oil and minerals can be sourced elsewhere, he says, leading to a switch to a 鈥減olitical-military鈥?approach in their dealings.

鈥淎frica is invaluable as a political and diplomatic ally at the United Nations and to be part of a coalition that stands up to the United States on issues like Huawei, the WHO [World Health Organisation] and Xinjiang among other issues. So, going forward, Africa will remain a top priority for China just not necessarily in pure economic terms,鈥?Olander said.

With the US and China both competing for influence in Africa, it鈥檚 unclear whether their actions during the pandemic will change perceptions of either superpower on the continent. There have been calls, led by Ghana鈥檚 minister of finance Ken Ofori-Atta, for China to provide debt relief for African countries.

The US, on its part, has focused its support to Africa on risk communication, water and sanitation activities, and strengthening laboratories and surveillance, says Devermont. The US embassy in South Africa recently announced a $1.8-million donation of funds to the country鈥檚 Covid-19 response efforts to raise their spending to $2.7-million in total.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, it is clear African leaders are now eager to draw a line under the Guangzhou fiasco, with Nigeria鈥檚 Gbajabiamila saying everything has been 鈥渟orted out鈥? This is because picking a sustained fight with China could 鈥渏eopardise other parts of their national agendas that depend on the Chinese for trade, fighting Covid-19 and debt relief,鈥?Olander argues.

But he says, it is unclear if citizens in many of these countries are as keen to draw a line in the sand.

鈥淭his will probably blow over among the political elites but for a lot of their constituents across the continent who followed the drama on Facebook and Twitter, this whole experience left a bitter aftertaste.鈥?

OPINION

The first building that one comes across when entering the campus of the University of Zambia, which sits on the terraces of a busy motorway to and from the country鈥檚 international airport, is an imposing structure known as the Confucius institute.

That this institute, named after an icon of Chinese culture, has been erected so prominently at Zambia鈥檚 oldest and most prestigious university reveals, on the one hand, the long-term vision of its promoters, and, on the other, a nation not yet attuned to how foreign cultural symbols naturalise power and influence, especially in instances where little has been done to create and celebrate local symbols.

At one point the university鈥檚 principal administrators even planned to relocate from their crumbling offices into the new Chinese building. It took the intervention of Western diplomatic representatives for this plan to be abandoned, along with their threat to withdraw funding from the university if its top officials were to reside under the ideological banner of a rival superpower.

If Zambia has been singled out in this preface, it is only to give context to the rise of Confucius institutes across Africa. What one encounters in Lusaka has been mirrored across the continent.

Much ink has been spilled on the effects of China鈥檚 engagement with Africa on the economic front, but little has been said about its cultural diplomacy 鈥?and the Confucius institutes that are at the forefront of this, and have been since the first African Confucius institute was unveiled at the University of Nairobi in December 2005. That this subject has been neglected is unsurprising given that criticism of China鈥檚 role in Africa has largely been driven by France, Britain and the United States, countries that have their own vested interests and equivalent institutions of cultural indoctrination in most African nations.

There are grave issues at stake here, including the question of who sets the continental agenda; the paucity of forward-thinking African intellectual opinion on key debates about the continent鈥檚 fate; and the stifling of African agency on these matters.

As Africans who are fed up with being treated as if we are on the nether end of the civilisational scale, we need to discuss the aims of the Confucius institute 鈥?and similar institutions of soft power projection, such as the British Council and Alliance Fran莽aise 鈥?and the threats posed to African culture. Culture matters because it is the invisible thread that ties people together, or separates them.

Control through culture

The Confucius institute programme was founded in 2004 to promote Chinese culture on the international scene. It draws its leadership from the Communist Party of China and has since seen its presence throughout the world surge to more than 500 schools. Forty-eight of them are in Africa. This rapid expansion has coincided with the steady rise of China as an emerging global superpower, and reflects a long-term strategy aimed at securing the country鈥檚 growing influence abroad and fashioning the world order under its cultural imprint.

The founding of the school also represents an admission, perhaps learnt from the West, that economic and nuclear power can only go so far in terms of effective control of the world; that to truly control a people, one must influence the cultural habits, the language and belief systems of such a people 鈥?one must project 鈥渟oft power鈥?

This strategy of conquest has been deployed in Africa by France, Britain and the US 鈥?expressed through cultural industries and institutions such as the Alliance Fran莽aise, the British Council and the American Cultural Centre 鈥?with a devastating effect on the African psyche.

It is quite telling that the Confucius institutes have been presented as 鈥済ifts鈥?to Africa and as a way of 鈥渟trengthening鈥?Sino-Africa relations by making the latter understand China 鈥渂etter鈥? By giving the 鈥済ift鈥?the Chinese are creating the obligation to reciprocate, much in the same way that the 鈥渄evelopment aid鈥?gift has been used by the British, French and Americans. It is not surprising that development aid arose in Africa just after the formal end of colonialism.

In the short term, the Chinese use these institutes to mark their territory on the African landscape and this becomes a visible, symbolic marker of their power and presence on the continent in a way that is not as politically or socially sensitive as the creation of, say, a military base.

A school also becomes a medium of shifting ways of seeing the world and it is an exceedingly effective way for a state to build and extend its cultural capital internationally. Zambia offers an illustrative case study on this score.

The Trojan Horse

On May 7 China 鈥渟ubcontracted鈥?the Zambian government to start offering compulsory Chinese language lessons in Zambia鈥檚 public secondary schools. This followed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between representatives of the Confucius institute and the Zambian government. Chinese history is already part of Zambia鈥檚 high school curriculum.

One of Zambia鈥檚 diplomats, in justifying the MoU, claimed that since 鈥淐hinese is the most widely spoken language in the world, it is prudent that our children learn Chinese鈥? The official鈥檚 thinking points to an acknowledgement that in the future Zambians will largely be working for Chinese, and not Zambian, employers.

Most importantly, the signing of the MoU suggests that the Confucius institute is a Trojan Horse that China deploys to lure unsuspecting victims into ceding their sovereignty. Having arguably captured Zambia鈥檚 present leadership, the Chinese 鈥?who already enjoy considerable presence in the country鈥檚 strategic economic sectors 鈥?are now moving to capture Zambia鈥檚 future, starting at secondary school, before the targeted age group鈥檚 mental faculties develop or recognise the entrapment.

Thus, Zambia has effectively laid at the disposal of the Chinese its public education system to complement the Confucius institute in producing large numbers of the would-be local labourers, administrators, interpreters and other accessories of this colonialism by stealth. This is a point that was lost on the country鈥檚 permanent secretary in the ministry of higher education, Mabvuto Sakala, leader of the delegation that travelled to Beijing to sign the MoU, when he addressed officials from Zambia鈥檚 mission to China.

He said: 鈥淲e want to ensure that we have an assured pipeline of trained Chinese language teachers to support the national rollout of Chinese training and assessment by the Examinations Council of Zambia. In this light we will be discussing with our counterparts here [in China] the development of a fast-track local teacher [training] programme as prepared by the Confucius institute at the University of Zambia.鈥?
Not only will Chinese be on Zambia鈥檚 national curriculum, but those who teach will 鈥?in the short term, at least, given the lack of qualified Zambians 鈥?have to come from China, imported to smooth Zambia鈥檚 path into vassalage.

The English employed a similar strategy when colonising Zambia in the late 1800s and early 1900s. They sent or 鈥渄onated鈥?Christian missionaries, teachers, lawyers and judges, law-enforcement forces and administrators to the territory, who all served as a foundation stone for future conquest. The Chinese may seek to replicate this strategy because it enables the coloniser to conquer 鈥渢he natives鈥?with uninformed consent and to subtly export jobs for its population overseas. (The Bank of China, largely dedicated to servicing this emerging colonial infrastructure, already exists in Lusaka).

Linguistic colonisation

In the long term, these 鈥済ifts鈥? such as the Confucius institutes, soften the general populace into paying 鈥渢ribute鈥?to those who become perceived as powerful benefactors. That they are being constructed on sites of national significance or in ways that dominate the landscape speaks to this long-term vision. The point is that Chinese imperialism, like all imperialisms, recognises that it must empty Africans of their independent human essence if it is to thrive and defeat existing patterns of social practices that inform locals鈥?knowledge and understanding of the world, and how they recreate and interact with it, be it through customs, moral norms, laws, beliefs, tastes, art or other forms of cultural expression.

Confucius institutes are therefore nothing but China鈥檚 drones or vehicles for global dominance effected in the cultural sphere through the promotion of Chinese language, tastes, education, architecture, music, food, movies, beliefs, banks, dressing, art, film, thinking patterns, history and lifestyle, to be continued until such a time that these would have supplanted existing cultural precepts and raised local agents who would become the ambassadors or defenders of the new imposed order themselves.

A fertile ground already exists for the new coloniser. In Zambia, for instance, many are yet to understand Beijing鈥檚 wider motives beyond the surface or official rhetoric and are consequently accepting of these 鈥済ifts鈥?as though they are unproblematic. As a result, it is easy for China to institute linguistic colonisation, one that captures and gradually establishes a firm grip on the mind, mannerisms, opinions and thinking patterns of the target.

Thus, even before she recovers from the debilitating threat that the use of a colonial language, English, poses to its struggle for nationhood, Zambia has moved to impose another foreign language on itself. This is understandable, though, given both the acutely low levels of historical consciousness among the country鈥檚 public leaders and the lack of serious national conversations on such crucial subjects. Getting people in captivity who are not aware of their bondage to realise that they are, in fact, in need of liberating or redemption is generally a hard task. It is difficult to extricate oneself from a history where one鈥檚 life experiences are strongly entangled in unequal relations to that of the coloniser 鈥?how does one unpick their education, their built environment, their foods, language, tastes, etcetera and throw it back?

Culture is dynamic; it evolves at every epoch and with every generation, and therein lies its creativity but also its vulnerability. It is creative because it is not static and, like life, it renews itself amid changing socioeconomic and political contexts. It is vulnerable because some cultures are being eroded and replaced with others, usually those that are more dominant.

Whether or not Africa鈥檚 new imperial suitor succeeds in its aims depends, in large part, on the resilience of the host cultures, the strength of the host economies, and the consciousness and agency of the host populations, exemplified by the local leadership.

It is probably easy for cultures such as that of the US to resist or at least manage external influences. For African cultures, already beleaguered by centuries of Western domination and operating in the imperial supremacist economic and social structures, which make Africa fertile ground for neocolonialism, the rise of Confucius institutes is a threat.

On a continent where the major cultural industries 鈥?film, television, music and food chains 鈥?are already dominated by Europe and the US, the establishment and spread of these schools threatens to further frustrate efforts to resuscitate Africans鈥?sense of self-belief and identity. It is a new form of colonialism, more subtle and in some ways more dangerous. Unlike the Western interventionism of the continuing past, it enjoys the consent of those on which it is preying, with deleterious consequences that will only become clear with time.

Learning from the past

Imperialism in the 21st century is cultural, soft, digital, less conflictual and effected in spheres where the imperial West lacks the moral high ground to disparage China鈥檚 actions. For instance, France has more than 931 cultural centres in the world, followed by China (531), United Kingdom (191), Germany (151), US (105) and Portugal (90), as of December 2018. Many of these cultural tools of Western imperial hegemony are in Africa.

By infusing the institutes into existing national educational institutions, the Chinese are investing and securing the spread of their ideas and culture into the minds of Africa鈥檚 would-be leaders in industry, academia and politics.

Tens of thousands of Africans from all influential echelons of society travel to China regularly on state-sanctioned trips of indoctrination. This strategy of conquest is not new. The British, French, Portuguese and US have all previously employed it. They still employ it to this day. Also not new is the tragic failure of African leaders to learn from history. As a result, Africa continues to learn languages of foreign powers, none of whom learns Africa鈥檚 languages. The continent refuses to see anything wrong with this and remains, to outsiders, a phenomenon of great amusement and spectacle, including on how lowly it thinks of itself and conducts its internal affairs.

The establishment of the Confucius institute in many African countries has gone hand in hand with the establishment of a Chinese International School. Learning Chinese language is mandatory in both outlets since it is the medium of instruction. Education, acquired through scholarships to China and through Chinese schools, captures the promising youth of Africa, implicates them in Chinese philosophies, material and ideological exchanges, and creates a moral indebtedness that is difficult to totally unpick.

One possible outcome for this scenario is the production of a national leadership with a sense of alienation from its own settings and which may look East, seeking to imitate the increasingly assertive and emboldened position as well as the values of the Chinese Communist Party, which recently held a congress where the leadership of Xi Jinping was given almost unassailable status.

Other possible threats include the continued marginalisation of African languages, symbols and heroes, and the resultant self-emasculation of the African identity and other worse forms of enslavement that have never before been experienced; the increased subservience of African cultures to foreign ones; the rise of China Towns on the African landscape, expressed through new export growth centres and multi-economic zones; and the preservation of Africa鈥檚 position at the bottom of the global value chain.

Combined with the devastating effects of American, British and French imperial presences on African culture, which are already entrenched, winning the ongoing cultural war that the Chinese have joined will be tough for Africa, requiring an ideological mindshift, a strong and enlightened national leadership and significant consensus. People would need to be willing to endure a period of upheaval.

Africa has many needs, but Confucius institutes, Alliances Fran莽aise, American Cultural Centres, British Councils or any other foreign institution of cultural control are not among them. What Africa needs are its own ideological schools for building capacity in so many areas where it has a deficit. What Africa needs is a serious discourse initiated and led by Africans on what explains the continent鈥檚 current position on the world scale of progress, and on what this continent can do internally to develop, to define its own priorities and engage with the rest of the world on its own terms.

And if Africans must write their own history, it must be both in practice, by defeating the forces that dehumanise them and destroying their symbols and in the realm of ideas 鈥?capturing the centre stage as the subjects of history themselves 鈥?by writing and singing about their cultures and victories. In short, what Africans need is to reject what they have become 鈥?cheap labourers for foreign-owned corporations and political leaders who strut around when they are nothing but the disposable playthings of corporations and foreign powers 鈥?fight to rediscover their full humanity, and be willing to pay the full price for their complete liberation.

Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong鈥檕 once wrote that: 鈥淥ur lives are a battlefield on which is fought a continuous war between the forces that are pledged to confirm our humanity and those determined to dismantle it; those who strive to build a protective wall around it, and those who wish to pull it down; those who seek to mould it and those committed to breaking it up; those who aim to open our eyes, to make us see the light and look to tomorrow and those who wish to lull us into closing our eyes.鈥?
The question is: When will Africa wake up and free itself from clinging on to the adopted and false consciousness of an ideological worldview that reinforces the power and interests of the very forces that are committed to dismantling it, pulling down the emerging protective wall around it and lulling its inhabitants into closing their eyes so that, as they did before, they sleep again and condemn themselves further into the abyss? When will Africans fully realise the power that comes from our own culture, and the weakness that comes from being bound by the narrow confines of imperial culture?

RIGHT OF REPLY

This is a response to Mathew Blatchford鈥檚 column 鈥楧on鈥檛 attack the Chinese 鈥?learn from their example鈥? which was itself a response to Sishuwa Sishuwa鈥檚 essay 鈥楥ultural imperialism with Chinese characteristics鈥?

Ordinarily, I do not respond to reactions to my articles that make no attempt whatsoever to engage with the substance of my writing. I believe that ad hominems, however well presented, are not arguments.

Mathew Blatchford鈥檚 reply to my article, Cultural imperialism with Chinese characteristics, falls into this category. 鈥楧on鈥檛 attack the Chinese 鈥?learn from their example鈥?is so devoid of substance that any response to it risks conferring upon it a seriousness it in no way deserves. Nevertheless, in pursuit of genuine intellectual debate, I have broken my own rules on ad hominems and made a rare exception.

To recall: the premise of my argument was that Confucius institutes in Africa should be seen as an extension of China鈥檚 economic dominance and expression of cultural power. I developed this point with examples from Zambia, in particular, and the African continent more generally. Blatchford neither disputes my core argument nor offers any alternative explanation to my assertion that the institute is a Trojan horse at the frontline of China鈥檚 neocolonial project.

At a glance, I welcomed his contribution in the belief that he was joining the debate on an important subject that I think deserves wider discussion. A closer reading of his article subsequently shows that debating by way of attacking the dissenter鈥檚 thoughts and demonstrating the weaknesses inherent in them was the least of Blatchford鈥檚 objectives. The University of Fort Hare academic was far more interested in discrediting me and rubbishing everything I say, have said or ever will say about China.

The style he uses to achieve his aims is to boldly state that I have not proven my case and to suggest ulterior motives (read: to support and advance the interests of my colonial educators), while at no point does he categorically affirm or state anything himself. Allowing his drivel to go unchallenged would leave readers uncertain about what my true affiliations are and the dynamics that underline China鈥檚 use of the Confucius institutes to grow its cultural capital in Africa. So let us unpack his ad hominems on a case-by-case basis. Blatchford starts his reaction to my article with an acknowledgement of China鈥檚 vast power.

鈥楾he People鈥檚 Republic of China is an extremely powerful nation; the largest national economy on the planet and a major military power, one which is deeply concerned with sustaining its access to the natural resources of Arabia, Africa and Oceania upon which it depends. Hence, its foreign activities need to be viewed with suspicion: Are they intended to foster some kind of imperial agenda, in the way that the foreign activities of other powerful nations do?鈥?
Comment: why is Blatchford concerned about China鈥檚 quest for global dominance to warrant the inclusion of this paragraph as his opening lines? Why does he think 鈥榠ts foreign activities need to be viewed with suspicion鈥? What explains his lack of concern with China鈥檚 internal development? Is it because any ambition for global power or economic dominance is bad? If it is, why? If it is not bad, why? China has already shown that it can cripple. Italy has already fallen prey to the power of China. Sri Lanka has, too. At the heart of Donald Trump鈥檚 鈥楢merica First鈥?nationalism is a struggle to stand up to the imperial aspirations of China, notwithstanding the power of the United States. Why then should we, the weak in Africa, cheer China鈥檚 activities on and roll the red carpet for the rising Eastern power? Blatchford offers no responses to these questions including his own. He is merely buying time and the attention of the reader before hitting his target.

Here is the University of Fort Hare teacher again: 鈥淚n any country that has undergone colonial and imperial oppression, such as all African countries, ulterior motives are often suspected. Accusations of colonialism, in particular, are dangerously easy to make and therefore often made for the purposes of manipulation rather than genuine anti-colonialism. After all, colonialism was real, and neocolonialism is a clear and present danger, so it is tempting to make accusations on the grounds of 鈥榖etter safe than sorry鈥? Yet all too often, what is called 鈥渄ecolonisation鈥?is simply exploitation of racial resentment, as in attacks on colonial symbols or attacks on white competitors by African aspirants to jobs.鈥?
Comment: Here, notice how Blatchford easily sees 鈥榰lterior motives鈥?in the possible awareness and resistance efforts of the (would-be) subjects of colonial and imperial oppression, not in the objectives of the suitors. Somehow, ulterior motives have no space in China鈥檚 relationship with the continent. Why? Because a University of Fort Hare teacher has said so. As a result, African countries should welcome the new imperial suitor because she means well unlike those who previously colonised them. This is as ludicrous as telling a former slave that the person turning them into a slave today is far much better than the one who turned them into a slave before. Enslavement should not and should never be graded. As for the perils of colonialism, many Africans, who have had to endure centuries of domination, should know better than what Blatchford cares to tell them. For many of them, colonialism is neither the past nor a clear danger. It is a real and an everyday lived experience. The fact of my struggle to communicate with Blatchford in this language, for instance, provides enough evidence.

Blatchford presents 鈥榙ecolonisation鈥?that seeks to bring down historical statues of white supremacists and transfer jobs held by whites to black Africans as amounting to racism. To provide context to this: the University of Fort Hare teacher, in making the claim about colonial symbols, had South Africa in mind and the bringing down of Cecil John Rhodes鈥?statue at the University of Cape Town. Now, I think that the destruction of historic symbols that represent our dehumanised self is a tough question to crack: should we or should we not destroy these symbols?

To argue that we must respect history no matter how bitter and painful this may be is also to ignore the most obvious fact: history is not neutral 鈥?it is always the story of the victors. That is why I insist that if we Africans must write our own history, it must be both in practice (defeating the forces that dehumanise us and destroying their symbols) and in the realm of ideas 鈥?capturing the centre stage as the subjects of history ourselves 鈥?by writing and singing about how we destroyed symbols of imperialism.

My problem with the Rhodes Statue is not so much that it should or should not have been destroyed. Rather it is that black South Africans are attacking symbols of their dehumanisation without simultaneously working to destroy the white supremacist economic and social structures, which press them down. This is the problem. The tree must not simply be shaken. Its roots, in my view, must be uprooted and thrown away. For without major disruptions to these entrenched supremacist structures, the oppression, domination and dispossession of black South Africans, their war for freedom, for full human emancipation, is incomplete.

The past in South Africa is still the present and, in this context, those who benefit from the status quo do not expect black Africans to write their own history and erect their own symbols. Nor, for that matter, does it make sense, to such beneficiaries for black South Africans to start to pull down the symbols of their dispossessors, oppressors and dominators. Blatchford seems to agree that colonialism is bad. If it is, why, then, is fighting it not good? Does the Fort Hare teacher really believe what he is writing?

The jibe about jobs, whose context is again South Africa, where a minority dominates in superior occupational positions, demonstrates Blatchford鈥檚 attempt to conceal racial prejudices and superiority, and his possible failure to come to terms with the changing reality of seeing yesterday鈥檚 messengers and toilet cleaners as today鈥檚 university deans and property owners. There is nothing wrong with aspiring for any job if one has the requisite qualifications and competencies for it.

Let us get the next quote from the University of Fort Hare teacher:

鈥楢nother source of ulterior motive is the actual colonial power, the United States and its satellites. For several years now, the US has been waging an undeclared war against China, and a large part of this war is embodied in propaganda. Anyone officially associated with Western ideology, or trained up through Western institutions, is liable to be contaminated with the sinophobia that Western media and its associated intelligentsia promotes. This tendency is particularly marked in countries that have little or no indigenous ideological structures, or where the local structures have been penetrated or supplanted by neocolonial structures.鈥?
Comment: It is under this paragraph where Blatchford鈥檚 blatant contempt for Africa, its structures, ideological apparatus or lack of them, and for those Africans who were partly educated in Europe or the United States comes to the fore. In it, he sets me up as a target. If the bio placed at the end of my article easily confirmed my Zambian nationality, a simple search of my name on Google must have told Blatchford that the University of Oxford was the site of my postgraduate studies. He then proceeded to focus on the individual making the argument, not the substance of the argument. Blatchford鈥檚 earlier assertion about my so-called 鈥榰lterior motives鈥?should be seen in this context: as a basis for inviting readers to be suspicious of anything said by anyone educated in a Western institution. To him and those of his ilk, Africans who were partly 鈥榯rained up through Western institutions鈥? like I was, are spokespersons of Western interests with no mind of their own. We lack the legitimacy to 鈥榓ttack the Chinese鈥? as per the title of his opinion piece, because, as graduates of Western imperialism, we are permanently indoctrinated.

To attack the Chinese would be to commit the reprehensible 鈥榮in鈥?of arming or making the West stronger against China. Presumably, we can only acquire the right to question China鈥檚 actions in Africa if we had studied in China or non-Western countries. Since I was educated in the West, I should shut up because I am probably infected with the virus of 鈥楽inophobia that Western media and its associated intelligentsia promotes鈥? Blatchford does not imagine that Africans trained in Western institutions are capable of formulating independent thought. To him, our training can only enable us to know the narrow confines of imperial knowledge 鈥?and to see with imperial eyes alone. This is the highest degree of cultural prejudice.

The idea that indoctrination is particularly rife in African countries that have no 鈥榠ndigenous ideological structures, or where the local structures have been penetrated or supplanted by neocolonial structures鈥?demonstrates precisely why Africa needs its own ideological schools for building capacity in so many areas where it has a deficit. It is the surest way of depriving Blatchford and his type the ammunition they need to disparage the continent. Until we have set up our own ideological schools, those of us from the colonial world, especially from impoverished countries with no 鈥榠ndigenous ideological structures鈥? cannot, in the judgement of Blatchford, have an independent position; we can only adopt the position of our former colonisers. If we are against China, then we are for America or Western imperialism. This is a scare and psychological tactic meant to silence affected Africans who may wish to join this discussion. If we speak, the assumption is that it is not because we are rational, informed and outraged. It is because we must have a motive, and not a genuine one but ulterior, driven primarily by the fact that we were once enslaved, educated in the West and our impoverished countries are ideology-free. As a result, we probably are just angry, but even our anger itself must be examined because it may turn out that we are just afraid. This is not rational debate. It is something else.

The University of Fort Hare teacher again: 鈥淪ishuwa says that Chinese cultural imperialism is a threat to Africa鈥檚 indigenous culture. This claim is based on the Zambian government鈥檚 decision to make Mandarin compulsory for all schoolchildren. Unfortunately, there is no such decision; the government has decided to make Mandarin an optional second language at all Zambian schools, a decision sponsored by the Chinese government. Thus, Sishuwa鈥檚 article is founded on a misrepresentation of the situation, which would not be necessary if he had a good case.鈥?
Comment: Blatchford dismisses my point that Mandarin is to be offered on a compulsory basis to all secondary schoolchildren in Zambia as 鈥榓 misrepresentation of the situation鈥? His assertion that Chinese is to be offered as an optional subject is not based on any alternative evidence. The reader must believe Blatchford because he has said it. What kind of arrogance is this? What will Blatchford do when Mandarin is rolled out on a compulsory basis in Zambia鈥檚 secondary schools 鈥?withdraw his article?

Blatchford again: 鈥淎part from this misrepresentation, however, Sishuwa has no case at all. No evidence is presented that the People鈥檚 Republic of China鈥檚 undoubted efforts to promote Chinese culture and the Mandarin language in Zambia pose any kind of threat to Zambian independence or cultural integrity. Actually, no evidence at all is presented that the People鈥檚 Republic of China is behaving in a colonial or imperialist way in Zambia. Perhaps it is, but if Sishuwa wishes to convince a sceptical reader that China is a menace to Zambian autonomy, he ought at least to provide examples.鈥?
Comment: Did the Fort Hare teacher really read my article? Had he done so, he would have noted that I started the discussion by saying that the Confucius institute building is situated right at the entrance to the main university. I talked about what this symbolism means and how the university鈥檚 principal administrators wanted suddenly to abandon their crumbling offices and stampede into the majestic Red Dragon building. It took another imperial power, one that only recently also constructed a lecture theatre near the same site, to stop them. Does Blatchford understand the implications of all this? How is it possible that Zambia鈥檚 main university is now the site of ideological rivalries between competing world powers that are using buildings to mark their territory on its landscape in a visible and symbolic show of their influence and presence? What does it say when the gatekeepers seek to flee from run-down buildings owned and operated by themselves in order to seek shelter in a new building owned and operated by a foreign power 鈥?only for a rival power to frustrate their escape with threats to withdraw funding to the university? If the educated Zambians can behave that way, with the Zambian government clapping them on, how about an ordinary Zambian? This is the substance: how these buildings subtly communicate and embody power.

I then proceeded to discuss the fact that the whole country would be teaching Mandarin at secondary, not university, school level. The fact that the government has succumbed to this decision reflects poorly on Zambia鈥檚 public leaders and also demonstrates the imperial power of China, which is sponsoring the teaching of Mandarin. In a country that is very backward in science and mathematics, where was it decided that Mandarin was the missing priority? In fact, if there is one thing that Zambia鈥檚 school curriculum is presently not missing, it is Mandarin. Blatchford deletes and makes disappear the substance of what I am debating and demands the very 鈥榚xamples鈥?I provided.

The Fort Hare teacher again: 鈥淏ut China hasn鈥檛 invaded Africa, doesn鈥檛 appear to be involved in political destabilisation, and is probably less economically manipulative than, say, the European Union or Brazil. Hence, China鈥檚 cultural imperialism is not obviously linked to anything sinister 鈥?unless, like the 鈥淵ellow Peril鈥?propagandists of the last century, one believes that the existence of Chinese people is, ipso facto, sinister. (One photograph accompanying the article showed Chinese people being flagrantly Chinese in Africa, which suggests that this is as much a crime as 鈥渄riving while black鈥?is in the US.)鈥?
Comment: What exactly does Blatchford understand as invasion? Physical occupation of another country complete with an invading army? China is not invading Africa using its military power similar to the one that accompanied the imposition of European colonialism in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Neither is Beijing doing so using the Bible or colonial handmaidens in form of missionaries like David Livingstone. China is using both economic and soft power to establish its conquest of the continent. The fact that the Chinese are not using the lethal force the European powers did when establishing colonial rule in Africa does not mean we are not being invaded. We are being invaded at our weakest point 鈥?a time of impoverishment coupled with the willingness of what is effectively a gangster lender to trap us using money as bait. If Zambia is prepared to offer its educational system as a platform for a major power to smooth its self-initiated passage into vassalage in exchange for a loan, why would such a power use bullets in this instance?

I had no say in the choice of images that accompanied my article. They were obviously editorial decisions made by the Mail & Guardian but such was Blatchford鈥檚 readiness to latch onto straw-men that he could not resist taking a cheap shot at me.

Blatchford: 鈥淭here are several questions to ask about this, but the first is: Who does it objectively serve? Who gains from a sustained attempt to repackage Chinese attempts to expand its cultural influence as imperialism? If such an attempt succeeds, it must harm Chinese influence and, therefore, help those opposed to China 鈥?that is, the US and its satellites, Britain and France, who together make up the main imperialist and neocolonial force intervening in Africa.鈥?
Comment: Here, the Fort Hare teacher returns to his core theme: we in the colonial world should automatically shut up. The debate must be between China and the West because when we open our mouths to complain, we are building the US, Britain and France. So China鈥檚 friends are Africa鈥檚 friends, its enemies Africa鈥檚 enemies. This does not make sense at all. No, we have the responsibility to complain, to blow the whistle and articulate our concerns, primarily for our own benefit. China and the US plus its Western allies are imperialist. If the US, Germany, United Kingdom and other Nato countries are on one side, China, Russia, Turkey and Iran are on the other. The competition between them is over resources and global dominance. Africa, like Syria and Venezuela, is simply one of their battlegrounds. It is in the interest of those on the receiving end to resist and defeat both.

The Fort Hare teacher: 鈥淪ishuwa claims that he wishes to see Africa develop its own cultural and political tropes (and, presumably, more substantive socioeconomic forces) to challenge this imperialism and neocolonialism. In practice his entire article, and most of what he has done elsewhere, suggests an agenda pandering both to crude Sinophobia and to subordination to the forces benefiting from it.鈥?
Comment: I invite Blatchford to re-read my piece with dispassionate eyes. Sometimes we see what we see not because that is what is there to be seen but because that is what we want to see. Jaundiced eyes make this falsification of reality possible. The key to my piece is right in the early paragraphs: I make it very clear that I am against Western imperialism. And the Confucius institutes and its global reach is well captured factually in my piece, including the fact that it is the Chinese government that actually made the decision to have Mandarin taught in Zambian schools 鈥?a point that Blatchford does not dispute. The phrase 鈥榤ost of what he has done elsewhere鈥?derives from his method: to impress on the reader my untrustworthiness now and in future, especially on all subjects Chinese. What is this other work that I have done elsewhere?

Blatchford concludes: 鈥淐hina is one of very few countries to break free of the colonial stranglehold. Rather than blindly attacking the Chinese, it might be sensible to try to learn from their example. One of the things that China did, for instance, was to pendulum between first Russia and then the US without ever being blindly subordinated to either, until it was strong enough to stand by itself. If this is the case, then it might actually be sensible to support Chinese influence in Africa to provide a counterbalance to Nato鈥檚 influence. It鈥檚 worth remembering that this was the stance of the old Non-Aligned Movement, upon which the Organisation of African Unity was founded. Perhaps, rather than shouting in chorus with the imperialists and the racists, such policies might be worth revisiting?鈥?
Comment: The conclusion offers the only time that Blatchford tried to argue with evidence, but it is false evidence. The formation of the Organisation of African Unity was not founded on that basis that Blatchford alleges. When Kwame Nkrumah and his friends met in 1963, their goal was to create a united Africa. It was for the continent to gang up and create one army and one currency 鈥?in short, a united front that would be a force to reckon with and that would stand up against imperial machinations like those of China, the US, and its satellites in Europe. As for the idea that there was success in being non-aligned, it simply lacks empirical evidence. What did Africa actually benefit from that posturing? If anything, neither of the competing Cold War streams fully trusted the continent to properly incorporate it in their faction.

Yes, Africa must learn 鈥?from itself and its history, from China, the US, Europe, etc. But those lessons should never be the ones prescribed to us by China or its apologists, or by the imperial West. We must resist the subordination of our agendas and priorities to outside forces, be them Chinese or American, or European. Instead, we must draw from the wealth of our distinct experiences to chart a clear course for ourselves. Africa should not return to non-aligned claptrap. The international context has changed drastically and the distribution of power that existed during the Cold War era has changed. China and Russia are no longer communist societies and Africa does not have its old ideological complexion.

The thrust of neoliberalism has wiped out any ideological pretensions on the continent. We have to rebuild its resistance again. To do that, we must see the actual dangers posed by the US and China, in the same way that we should have seen the seemingly innocuous arrival of David Livingstone as a hazard. We now have the experience to learn and respond better. As we do so, we must remember Thabo Mbeki鈥檚 warning: 鈥淲e must free ourselves of the 鈥榝riends鈥?who populate our ranks, originating from the world of the rich, who come to us, perhaps dressed in jeans and T-shirts, as advisers and consultants, while we end up as the voice that gives popular legitimacy to decisions we neither made, nor intended to make, which our 鈥榝riends鈥?made for us, taking advantage of an admission that perhaps we are not sufficiently educated.鈥?

"South Africa missed an opportunity to increase trade when it failed to show off its resources at the China International Import Expo, held in Shanghai. (Aly Song/Reuters)

The South African pavilion was a 鈥榙isservice to the country鈥?鈥?and no one could speak Mandarin

Shanghai 鈥?Participants and observers alike have slammed the sorry state of South Africa鈥檚 pavilion at the first China International Import Expo, one of the largest trade fairs ever held.

鈥淚f you look at the set-up of the South African pavilion, it was shabbily done. If you look at the products displayed, South Africa could have done better,鈥?said David Monyae, co-director of the Confucius institute in South Africa. 鈥淚n terms of the vision and the effort put in, it looks like the department of trade and industry just woke up one morning and set up a table. It was poorly done. A disservice to the country.鈥?
The Mail & Guardian visited the South African pavilion on Tuesday morning, the first day the expo was open to the public, and it was difficult to disagree with Monyae鈥檚 assessment. Despite occupying a prime position opposite the pavilion of China 鈥?a placement intended as a mark of respect from the hosts 鈥?several South African booths were unoccupied, and others were still being readied, with boxes and promotional materials littering the floor.

The products on display were hardly a showcase of the best that South Africa has to offer. It included a line of children鈥檚 leather shoes and a generic peri-peri sauce brand. One participant, Beef Master Kimberley, said that they were not interested in growing their existing trade with China because they had no capacity, and were only participating at the behest of the trade and industry department. Another, the Northern Cape economic development agency, had not thought to bring tasters for the selection of the province鈥檚 wines it was trying to flog (in contrast, other wine producers such as Australia and Chile had set up enticing bar areas that attracted much interest).

Most damningly, not a single South African participant spoke Mandarin, or had employed translators, leaving them unable to communicate with the vast majority of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese business people streaming through the expo鈥檚 halls. Only one of the dozen or so South African booths had bothered to prepare any Chinese language materials.

Nor were some of South Africa鈥檚 key industries represented. Inexplicably, there was no tourism stand, despite the fact that the market for tourists from China is anticipated to grow exponentially over the next decade.

National shop window

The import expo, held in Shanghai, attracted more than 300 companies from 170 countries. More than 130 countries put together country pavilions, which function as a sort of shop window for nation states: a chance for each to make its elevator pitch, explaining what it has to offer and why it is worthy of investment. The point is not just to make a good impression, but also to attract a share of the $10-trillion that China has promised to spend on imports in the next 15 years.

Aly Song/Reuters

On this showing, not much of that money will be coming South Africa鈥檚 way.

鈥淚鈥檒l tell you one thing: we need to up our game,鈥?said Dumi Mbatha, who was manning a booth on behalf of the Dube Tradeport, a special economic zone based in KwaZulu-Natal.

She said South Africa鈥檚 offerings compared poorly with the high-tech products on display in other country pavilions. 鈥淭he minister [Trade Minister Rob Davies] was here earlier. I hope he was taking notes.鈥?
Sandile Ndlovu, the executive director of the South African Aerospace, Maritime and Defence Industries Association Export Council, which was represented at the expo, was equally scathing in his assessment. 鈥淭he defence industry is the only value-added industry in the South African pavilion. [South Africa] really missed the boat. And we are right opposite the Chinese pavilion. It is a prime spot.鈥?
Another participant, who asked to remain unnamed, said the South African pavilion 鈥渋s not at the level鈥?of its competitors.

South Africa鈥檚 poor showing was especially stark in contrast with its African rivals. In particular, Ethiopia, Kenya and Senegal produced slick, sophisticated exhibits that projected an image of efficiency and professionalism, complete with interactive displays and Mandarin speakers to translate.

Nigeria鈥檚 pavilion, on the other hand, was arguably worse than South Africa鈥檚, consisting of little more than a few rocks labelled 鈥渕inerals鈥?and a chart that outlined the country鈥檚 vast oil reserves.

The M&G sought comment from the department official who organised the South African pavilion, but he declined to give his name or comment, on the basis that he is not authorised to speak to the media.

Monyae said: 鈥淪outh Africa has some of the most outstanding products that it failed to demonstrate with a Chinese audience that is rich with resources and willing to buy. It鈥檚 just unfortunate that South Africa failed to sell itself among so many other countries that have done better than South Africa, including Kenya, and Senegal, who were better in terms of organisation and efficiency and knowing what to pitch in terms of understanding their audience.鈥?
He added: 鈥淭his is a country that, under President [Cyril] Ramaphosa, is looking at foreign investments as the key issue to deal with unemployment, and to raise $100-billion in the next five years. There can never be a better place than at this exhibition to showcase the country and clearly state that South Africa is open for business. It鈥檚 disappointing for all South Africans.鈥?
China鈥檚 coming-out party

The expo was held in the world鈥檚 largest convention centre, purpose-built for the occasion. The event was about more than just trade: it was also the starting gun for China鈥檚 much-anticipated 鈥渟econd opening鈥? and a statement of intent from a newly confident superpower.

With China鈥檚 first opening, spearheaded by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, China cautiously re-entered world markets, setting the stage for rapid economic growth in subsequent decades. Although China has come a long way since then, trade remains tightly controlled and limited in scope, and foreign companies are allowed only restricted access to China鈥檚 population of 1.4-billion.

Some of these controls are about to be lifted, if Chinese leader Xi Jinping is to be believed. In his keynote speech in Shanghai, described by breathless state media as a legacy-defining moment, he announced plans to reduce tariffs and ease market access, positioning China as a champion of globalisation and the free market 鈥?especially relevant against the backdrop of the nascent trade war with the United States.

Aly Song/Reuters

鈥淐hina will not stop its effort to pursue higher-quality opening up! China will not stop its effort to pursue an open-world economy!鈥?said Xi (exclamation marks as per the official transcript; the president鈥檚 delivery was typically monotone).

Analysts are sceptical about the practical significance of Xi鈥檚 rhetoric, noting that this 鈥渟econd opening鈥?remains very much on China鈥檚 terms, and is still short on detail about which industries will be liberalised and to what extent. Other critics have noted that China鈥檚 鈥渟econd opening鈥?does not necessarily extend to its citizens: China鈥檚 human rights record remains questionable, especially in its Xinjiang province, where more than a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in 鈥渞e-education鈥?camps.

Symbolically, however, the significance of this event, and Xi鈥檚 speech, cannot be overstated. This was China鈥檚 coming out party as a confident superpower, made all the more remarkable by the presence of the global capitalist business elite bowing down before a communist state.

We are the future, China is saying, and in Shanghai this week everyone was putting their best foot forward in a bid to earn a piece of it. Everyone, that is, except South Africa.

COMMENT

The not-so-recent and not-so-minimal investments in the South African economy by Chinese corporations, and the Chinese government itself through state-owned enterprises and banks, carry numerous implications for education in South Africa. Such upshots cannot be taken too lightly.

South Africa has experienced a number of the economic difficulties in the past five years or so. These include political instability because of a number of Cabinet reshuffles, mainly under former president Jacob Zuma, and excessive looting of the state coffers. Zuma and organisations such as Black First Land First contended that the accusations against him were a result of his decisions to take South Africa 鈥淓ast鈥?and to join the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) bloc. This argument cannot survive scrutiny because South Africa鈥檚 relationship with China predated Zuma鈥檚 assumption of office.

In fact, this link can be traced to 1998, when Nelson Mandela formed relations with mainland China because of Taiwan.

South Africa remains tied to both the East and the West, and has done so since 1994. Indeed, since the democratic dispensation, Pretoria has opted for an open economic diplomacy that allows for diversity in partnerships and has opened doors for all, including Eastern countries who played critical roles in the fight against apartheid.

At the same time, however, it is worth mentioning that, although Britain, the European Union and the United States seem to have an upper hand in relations with South Africa, the unprecedented and growing influence of Beijing over the economy of South Africa is evident in its investments in more than 150 corporations that employ more than 30 00 people.

Chinese involvement in South Africa is further seen in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China鈥檚 20% stake in banking giant Standard Bank, as well as the fact that China is our largest single export and import partner. Furthermore, the Asian giant has opened up more than five Confucius institutes in the country that teach Mandarin and disseminate Chinese culture.

In 2015, the government announced it would in the following year introduce Mandarin as an additional language, beginning from the early grades, through to high school in a multiphased plan. Organisations and citizens criticised this move, arguing that South Africans were still grappling with their own languages, and that the introduction of Mandarin reeked of a takeover of our institutions of learning and cultivation of young minds.

This overlooks the benefits. To begin with, much of this criticism showed that many South Africans are not cognisant of the thousands of South Africans of Chinese descent who have lived here at least since the late 1800s. Thus, depriving them of an opportunity to learn their mother tongue can be considered unconstitutional (although Mandarin is not recognised in the Constitution).

But another crucial point missed is that Mandarin is an optional language, and one the country would benefit from if learnt. The dividends would lie in the fact that the country would have a window into what is one of the most mysterious political-economic machines, one we barely understand, but to which, in this globalised world, so much of our own economic fortunes are tied.

Not only has Mandarin been introduced into the curriculum, there has also been an increase in the number of South Africans taking up studying opportunities in China made possible by scholarships offered by the Chinese government.

A number of South Africans have the chance of an education even if it does not offer social reproduction as envisaged by the likes of bell hooks and Steve Biko. The move is also in contrast to the notions of a decolonised education demanded by the #RhodesMustFall and #FeesMustFall movements. After all, it has long been argued by renowned educationalists such as Paulo Freire that education is not devoid of ideology.

There are arguments about the mismatch of South African and Chinese standards with regard to medicine. There is also some pessimism, as if our students abroad are blank slates to be brainwashed in their temporary countries of learning. The opposite may be true. Perhaps, ironically, the greatest critics of Eurocentrism and the most vocal proponents of decolonisation have been Mandela-Rhodes scholarship recipients and others who have studied abroad, including Weidenfeld scholarship recipient, Oxford graduate and PhD candidate Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, author of the highly scathing Democracy & Delusion.

So, there is room for a more pragmatic midway view that does not see China as either a saintly benefactor or a neocolonial power in waiting. Rather, it is a matter of defining our interest in learning Mandarin, the language of more than a billion people worldwide. The most active Mandarin learners at the moment are in the US and the EU. These are not sites of Chinese neocolonialism as far as we know. There is also scope for the domestication of this language. For example, Professor Herbert Mushangwe, a co-director of the University of Zimbabwe Confucius institute, has written an introductory text to Mandarin based on Shona idioms, culture and social contexts.

China will not be taking over our classrooms. The teachers being trained are South Africans, and families, guardians, school governing bodies and the department of basic education maintain their powers of intervention. The fact that the introduction of Mandarin is phased means there is much more room to intervene early on.

"About 189,000 South African-born people are currently living in Australia. This number has been rising steadily over the past decade, with Melbourne and Sydney being the most popular destinations. There are numerous reasons why South Africans are moving to Australia. From a thriving economy to better opportunities, and even better education and healthcare, Australia gives them a great shot at a better life for themselves and their families compared to their home country. However, to stay afloat in Australia, it鈥檚 important to have a viable source of income. Luckily, there are a plethora of job opportunities available in Australia. This post explores how South Africans moving to Australia can prepare for job applications.

Understand the Visas

Australia offers various visa categories including students, skills migration, carres and visitors South Africans who intend to visit Australia have a number of different options available to them, which they can choose based on their circumstances and needs. Generally Australia has a rigorous visa regime therefore, it鈥檚 important to check and complete all requirements before applying to any type of visa. These requirements are also subject to change time to time depending on the visa type and country to country. The Working Holiday Visa allows South African to visit Australia for a year and work during their stay in Australia. They can further extend their stay in the country for 2 more years after completing 88 days of regional work.

On the other hand, for those wanting to work immediately they arrive in Australia, they need to obtain sponsorship (457 visas) through an Australian company who can hire them. All South Africans that come to Australia are required to undergo a certificate of good character and complete an afp police check. The police check can be completed online.

A third option is to do both. Come to Australia with a Working Holiday Visa and then look for sponsorship after arrival.

Set Your Bank Account and Tax Number in Order.

First things first, South Africans moving to Australia need to open an Australian bank account. Moreover, they need to apply for a tax file number (TFN) as they can not work and find a job without a Tax File Number. Failure to do so is considered tax fraud and the penalty is the payment of the maximum tax rate of 46.5 percent. Besides this, committing such fraud can lead to visa cancellation and a further ban from the country.

Luckily, both the account number and TFN can be processed before arriving into the country.

Update Your CV

Many people underestimate the importance of having a well-written resume. The number one mistake people make is sending a generic resume for different job roles. You should prepare for job applications and your resume should include all your qualifications and the skills that are germane to the advertised job position. It is also important to include a custom cover letter and also write a good brief 60 seconds self introduction in your resume. Besides this, ensure that your resume does not have grammatical and spelling mistakes as one typo or error can ruin your claim of detail oriented. It is a good idea to proofread your resume and use grammarly to eliminate mistakes that can affect your job prospects.

Search Online

There are a plethora of online job listing services where South Africans moving to Australia can find thousands of vacancies. Popular job search engine sites in Australia include Seek, Jora, Indeed, Hays, Career One and LinkedIn.

Networking is Key

LinkedIn launched in 2003 and it is now the world鈥檚 largest professional networking platform, with over 690 million registered users from around the world and across all industries.

LinkedIn serves as a public digital resume and portfolio platform, as a database for open opportunities, and as a social networking tool all in one. Unlike other job websites, LinkedIn allows you to add recruiters and other people of interest to your virtual network, making it the best website for connecting directly with recruiters and sending them your resume.

LinkedIn is free and it is worth your time and effort to make your profile up to date, accurate and detailed to get noticed by Australian-based recruiters.

Also, South Africans moving to Australia should not forget to take advantage of physical networking. By getting involved in their industry, they can easily become more noticed by potential employers. Many people start off with basic jobs like driving for Uber or working as a cabbie with a taxi in Canberra (Canberra is the capital city of Australia). This enables them to save money before moving on to more professional roles.

Finally, leveraging existing contacts is also a great way to find a job. Even in this day and age, the power of word-of-mouth cannot be overemphasized.

Wrapping up

South Africans who wanted to prepare for job applications and move to Australia should first do some research about Australian lifestyle, legal system, job opportunities and most importantly about the legal requirements for visa application and the restrictions that come with that visa type. There are plenty of opportunities available, so by following these suggestions, one can get a good idea of planning his/her trip beforehand and can increase their chances of finding a better job position."
"GERMANY University abandons plans for Confucius institute Tweet Stuttgarter Zeitung reported (in German).

The Students for a Free Tibet organisation issued a press release earlier this month celebrating the development as a win for academic freedom and democratic values. The group reports that it has sent nearly 300 letters to senior university officials in 30 countries urging them to close the controversial Confucius institutes, which have been criticised on the grounds that the universities that host them cede control over teaching to the Chinese government.

After various discussions with representatives of politics and economy we did not succeed in finding the necessary support for this project.""The Students for a Free Tibet organisation issued a press release earlier this month celebrating the development as a win for academic freedom and democratic values. The group reports that it has sent nearly 300 letters to senior university officials in 30 countries urging them to close the controversial Confucius institutes, which have been criticised on the grounds that the universities that host them cede control over teaching to the Chinese government.

The same point could be made about China's formal promotion of Mandarin and of Chinese culture and history via its Confucius institutes and Confucius Classrooms.



This is possibly the largest language promotion project the world has ever seen, taking place in just nine years since the first Confucius institute was opened in Seoul in November 2004.

While China's dramatic economic and trade impact on Africa has caught global attention, there has been little focus on its role in education. But there are important questions raised by China's education push into Africa.Why does China run one of the world's largest short-term training programmes, with plans to take 30,000 Africans to China between 2013 and 2015? Why does it give generous support to 38 Confucius institutes teaching Mandarin and Chinese culture at many of Africa's top universities from the Cape to Cairo?And why is China one of the very few countries to increase the number of full scholarships for Africans to study in its universities, with a total of 18,000 anticipated between 2013 and 2015?China is not pursuing these training and education initiatives because of support for the Millennium Development Goals, or MDGs, or the Education for All goals. These and other goals are being discussed a great deal at the moment, because of what may happen to the world's development after the deadline to meet them passes in 2015.But these debates are not yet so evident in China. At the moment, if you refer to 2015 in China, it has more significance in development circles as the date for the next meeting of the triennial Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Nor is China providing these training resources to Africa in the manner of a traditional donor from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD.China avoids the language of donors and recipients as much as possible, and shows no interest in becoming a member of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee , which measures donors' aid commitments and delivery.Instead, this provision of many different forms of training support is presented by China as South-South cooperation, or as elements in a new strategic partnership between China and Africa.At its simplest, China's efforts can be seen as just an example of 'win-win' cooperation, or as an illustration of 'common development'.

There are similar examples of win-win cooperation with many other countries in Africa.Cooperation in the development of human resources is part of China's soft power engagement with Africa rather than its considerable 'hard power' of infrastructure development , trade or material resources - still a large focus of China's engagement with the continent.It is this soft power that Lu Shaye , director general of African Affairs at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commended in 2013 as an ""indispensable"" element in China's diplomacy with Africa.Essentially, for him soft power means ""strengthening the cultural exchanges between China and Africa"".It is for this reason that education and training cooperation has been one of the 'red threads' of China's engagement with Africa right back to 1956 when China established diplomatic relations with Egypt.This whole discussion about the exact purpose of China's provision of training awards and of scholarships has been overtaken by the growth of trainee and student numbers.

"GLOBAL Embrace China's Confucius institutes Tweet



Perhaps (definitely) the best discussion of this issue has snowballed on the



Arguing quite eloquently, Kapp posits that the establishment of Confucius institutes in the United States higher education sector affords opportunities to US students who would otherwise not, in many cases, be exposed to the language, history and culture of this most fascinating country.



Kapp鈥檚 position is one I agree with more or less entirely, and especially with the crucial caveat inserted by Kapp:



鈥淪uch clear affirmations of academic freedom should be specified in each school鈥檚 agreement with Hanban, the Chinese agency sponsoring Confucius institutes. If Hanban cannot accept such stipulations, then there should be no agreement. The responsibility for determining that these commitments are being upheld should reside solely in the hands of the host institution.鈥?


High-level debate



Subsequent contributions to the debate come from some of the most highly regarded China scholars and China watchers around.



Jeff Wasserstrom at the University of California, Irvine, provides some anecdotal evidence from his personal experience of giving a lecture at a Confucius institute, which seems to challenge his healthy scepticism about such partnerships.



Jerome Cohen of New York University seems to agree with the unabashed criticism of Confucius institutes by Perry Link of the University of California, San Diego, before briefly recounting an award he received from a Confucius institute 鈥渢o recognise the importance of civil and political rights for China鈥?



Voices in support of Confucius institutes are in the minority, with only Robert Kapp and David Schlesinger largely in support.



Firmly in the skeptics camp are Isabel Hilton, Jonathan Mirsky, Steven I Levine (Montana), Matteo Mecacci, David Wertime, Winston Lord and 鈥?despite somewhat confusing supporting statements on personal experiences of Confucius institutes 鈥?Jeff Wasserstrom and Jerome Cohen.



Perry Link鈥檚 rebuttal and counter of Robert Kapp鈥檚 argument is certainly persuasive and is cited by both Winston Lord (enthusiastically) and Jerome Cohen (reluctantly) as pretty much infallible.



Isabel Hilton draws attention to national language and culture institutes such as the Goethe Institute, Alliance Francaise and the British Council, commending their independence from academia and their maintenance of some form of neutrality while fulfilling their soft power roles.



Yet there remains, at the heart of this discussion, a seemingly uncritical assumption that universities are, and should be, politically neutral institutions, all the while advocating disengagement from China on the basis of a political principle.



The university as a civil society institution



It is one of the 鈥榝acts鈥?of the Western world that universities exist on the basis of two core principles: freedom of enquiry and institutional autonomy.



Yet this view conveniently ignores the context out of which universities initially emerged and serves to reinforce the erroneous assumption that universities have always been created upon these two fundamental values.



European universities were established largely through monarchical charters and often at the behest of the papacy. This is true of most of the world鈥檚 oldest institutions, including Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge, St Andrews, Padua, Uppsala, Salamanca etc.



They were created either by the Holy Roman Empire, the papal states or monarchs of states in which they existed, with their political allegiances placing a question mark over any claims to autonomy; Oxford, for example, remained vehemently Royalist during the English Civil War.



US universities, which emerged from this tradition, can be questioned in terms of their inter-relationship with the state.



Following the Soviet Union鈥檚 success with Sputnik, United States higher education went through a process not dissimilar to that which Chinese higher education is now undergoing in terms of the injection of resources into science and technology research.



National Science Foundation congressional funding, for example, jumped by a factor of 15 in the decade from 1959 to 1968 鈥?from around US$35 million to US$500 million 鈥?with grants approved for research deemed to be of priority by the US government.



Caltech 鈥?the California Institute of Technology 鈥?for example, grew dramatically in the post-war and Cold War era; is famous as the home of NASA鈥檚 Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and is one of America鈥檚 many universities which have Reserve Officers' Training Corps to educate commissioned officers in the US military. It is, along with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT, one of the world鈥檚 pre-eminent institutions for the furthering of scientific knowledge, yet its evolution is rooted in a close relationship with the state.



The point I am making here is that universities can never be separated from the political entities in which they exist.



University autonomy and academic freedom are noble values to which all universities should aspire, but there is not a single institution in the world which can lay claim to being entirely autonomous or having total academic freedom.



This condition of the academy arises from the simple fact that universities derive their defining characteristics from the contexts out of which they emerge and solely at the discretion of the political entities which choose to bestow such liberties upon them and which guarantee those freedoms to a greater or lesser extent.



It seems to me that we all too often uncritically accept the belief that our universities 鈥?and I include European, United Kingdom, United States and other advanced nations in this 鈥?can be or are autonomous from the state.



On the contrary, they are not independent from the state, but are a civil society institution where consensus on the prevailing normative world view is negotiated.



Chinese higher education and state relations



In China, all universities are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education or the provincial or municipal education bureau.



There are approximately 115 national-level universities that report directly to the ministry in Beijing, while the remaining 2,190 higher education institutions are under the jurisdiction of the provincial or municipal education bureaus.



Of the total 2,305 higher education institutions, 1,090 are involved in four-year degree provision, with a smaller proportion approved for masters and doctoral degrees, while the remaining 1,215 provide three-year vocational diploma education. None of these universities confer their own degrees as all degrees in China are conferred by the Ministry of Education.



Institutions receive their funding directly from the Ministry of Education or education bureau for teaching, with the leading universities competing for research funds from different government departments including the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education and other national ministries and provincial governments.



All Chinese universities work to deliver research that contributes to national, provincial and local development goals as laid out in the five-year plans at various different levels of government.



China has a much greater recognition of the social function of the university and chooses not to cover up this fact, but rather to emphasise the central importance of higher education to national social, economic, cultural and political development.



Personally, I find this not to be insidious, but to be quite acutely and refreshingly realistic about the social function of the university and its relationship with the state.



It might not reflect my thinking on how a higher education sector should be, but as an academic I'm interested in understanding China's higher education sector on its own terms, with the hope of being better able to understand how it will continue to transform.



To criticise China's higher education system for not adhering to the same principles of autonomy and (arguably) academic freedom would serve only to identify me as viewing China as a problem to be solved and that, I strongly argue, is an uncritical perspective which tells people more about my normative convictions than it does about the Chinese higher education system.



When conducting my doctoral research, I interviewed many Chinese university presidents, party secretaries and senior officials and academics 鈥?both formally and informally 鈥?which revealed the scale of this industrial policy approach to the higher education sector.



One particular quote stood out in my mind and serves to highlight the difference in attitudes towards higher education:



鈥溾€ur logic is not the same as their [Western] logic鈥estern logic holds that the university wants to be the smartest group of people in the world, right. If I have my opinion, if I think we should educate students in certain subjects, this is completely the right of the university [to decide]. The university鈥檚 right is paramount. But Chinese universities鈥hey have never been like this; [it鈥檚 about] what contribution can I make鈥?



At first, such a statement appears to serve to highlight the differences between Chinese and 鈥榃estern鈥?higher education. But I believe it is more useful to jettison the assumption prevalent in the West that universities can be autonomous. (I emphasise here that I think we should strive for that, but that it is not achievable).



It is here where I believe that Gramsci鈥檚 notion of the integral state, as a sum of political society and civil society, is extremely useful in framing the relationship between the state and higher education, regardless of national context.



The university as a part of the integral state



Gramsci defines political society in a manner similar to Althusser鈥檚 coercive state apparatus: the executive, judiciary, legislature, military, paramilitary, police force, civil service etc.



Yet Gramsci鈥檚 view on civil society rejects widely held notions of a sphere of activity, which exists independently of the state, to conceive of civil society as the terrain upon which the negotiation of consensus to a political elite鈥檚 world vision is negotiated.



Civil society institutions, after all, exist to represent the interests of their members to political society; civil society institutions such as trade unions, chambers of commerce, guilds, NGOs, pressure groups are inextricably linked to political society otherwise they would serve no purpose.



In this sense: universities are institutions for socialisation; play a significant role in the reproduction and transformation of social structures over time; are institutions which see academics often crossing or straddling the line between political and civil society to take up government posts and appointments; are intricately interwoven into the socio-political fabric of the nation state; and reflect (not determine) the widely-held values of the political entity in which they exist.



Confucius institutes as soft power



Confucius institutes form part of the outward projection of Chinese soft power, forming one half of a two-pronged soft-power strategy known as 鈥榠nvite in, go global鈥? They are administered through Hanban, an institution charged with the provision of Chinese language training and proficiency assessments which is affiliated to the Ministry of Education.



Confucius institutes themselves are not merely agreements between foreign universities and the Hanban. Each institute is led by a Chinese partner university. Staff selected for the Confucius institutes must come from the Chinese partner university and must be approved by Hanban for the appointment.



This is a central part of Confucius institute staffing arrangements, whereby the institute language staff are selected and assigned, but the institutional agreements involve the foreign university, the Chinese university and Hanban.



To engage or withdraw 鈥?The million dollar question



I find it confusing why this debate is being limited to engagement with Confucius institutes, though I suspect that wider discussion involving teaching and research collaborations with Chinese universities, or the huge increases in Chinese students at US universities in recent years, may make it inconvenient to extend the logic of the anti-institute discourse to institutional and departmental partnerships and exchange programmes.



Surely the underlying principle on which this scepticism of Confucius institutes is based would also lead to calls for US institutions to sever ties with Chinese universities, which are arguably even more closely supervised by the state than Confucius institutes.



US universities have, over the past decades, been pioneers of engagement with Chinese universities and the proposition that US universities should consider severing ties with Confucius institutes places that commendable effort under a dark cloud.



Johns Hopkins University has a long established operation in Nanjing, the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, while the University of California, Berkeley鈥檚 Institute of East Asian Studies relocated its inter-university programme from Taiwan to China in 1997 where it exists to this day providing world-class language training from its base on Tsinghua University鈥檚 campus.



Tsinghua itself was established by US missionaries after indemnity for the Boxer Rebellion was deemed excessive and Theodore Roosevelt secured congressional approval for scholarships to study in the US.



More recently, New York University opened its second portal campus, NYU Shanghai, in partnership with East China Normal University. Duke University continues to plan for the opening of Duke Kunshan University in partnership with Wuhan University in the city of Kunshan near Shanghai and Suzhou.



Kean University recently received final approval to enrol students at Wenzhou Kean University in southern Zhejiang. Michigan University has a long established partnership with Shanghai Jiao Tong University at their joint institute in Shanghai.



In addition, the US government has launched an initiative called the 100k Strong Programme which aims to have 100,000 US students taking some part of their undergraduate studies in China by 2015, which dovetails well with China鈥檚 plans to have 500,000 foreign students studying in China by 2020, 150,000 of whom will be enrolled on degree-seeking programmes at Chinese universities.



In terms of academic exchange, the great tradition of study abroad that forms a major characteristic of elite US higher education is also developing rapidly in and across China.



The University of California Education Abroad Program has initiatives at several national-level universities 鈥?including Peking University, Beijing Normal University and Fudan University 鈥?sending over 100 students per semester, and more for short-term summer programmes each year.



Recent figures suggest that total Sino-foreign collaborative education programmes approved by the Ministry of Education number over 1,500, with many of these involving US institutions.



The number of research tie-ups between China鈥檚 leading universities and universities in the US is growing all the time, with institutional and departmental collaboration across the full range of academic disciplines.



This is a phenomenon that is now moving in the opposite direction to see Chinese universities establishing overseas campuses in Malaysia and collaborative research and teaching centres in foreign countries.



Again, at the University of California, a major centre was established on-campus at San Diego. The Fudan-UC Center aims to connect all institutions in the University of California system with Fudan University.



The centre director is Professor Richard Marsden of UC San Diego who is joined by the chair of the executive board, Fudan Vice-President Lin Shangli, and academic board co-chairs Professor Peng Xizhe for Fudan and Professor Susan Shirk for San Diego.



In attendance at a symposium held at the Fudan-UC Center in December 2012 following the 18th Party Congress and sitting on the discussion panel were two contributors to the China File debate, Professor Jeff Wasserstrom and Professor Perry Link.



I would be interested to know how concerns about self-censorship with regards to Fudan-UC compare with the clear scepticism of Confucius institutes expressed by Link and Wasserstrom and what, if any, distinction could be made. Having said that, I think the Fudan-UC Center is a great venture for reasons explained towards the end of this piece.



Self-censorship and indoctrinating the automatons



Concerns about self-censorship expressed most clearly by Perry Link are obviously a major issue. But we must surely concede that self-censorship happens for a variety of reasons, with fear of Chinese Communist Party retaliation unlikely to be a factor on a US campus.



It is more likely that concerns about embarrassing the US university senior management will lead US scholars to self-censor. On a US campus, in a country that does guarantee freedom of expression and academic freedom, the only condition required for such concerns to become reality is for US scholars to fail to uphold their own principles.



Robert Kapp is right in his assertion that the responsibility rests with the home institution and, by extension, the scholars at that institution.



One of the most obvious issues I have to take with the argument against Confucius institutes on US campuses 鈥?or indeed, any other campuses 鈥?is the implicit argument that the Chinese government both desires and is capable of indoctrinating US students with a pro-party political opinion on US campuses through short-term language courses.



I would have hoped that attitudes towards US students from some of their leading China scholars would not be so quick to assume that the thought patterns of America鈥檚 youth would be so easily altered. As Raymond Williams once commented:



鈥淚f ideology were merely some abstract, imposed set of notions, if our social and political and cultural ideas and assumptions and habits were merely the result of specific manipulation, of a kind of overt training which might be simply ended or withdrawn, then society would be very much easier to move and change than in practice it has ever been or is.鈥?


Even more so, any paranoia about the capability of Confucius institutes to indoctrinate young Americans enrolled on language courses would logically also lead to calls for any and all US undergraduates to avoid studying at China鈥檚 universities and not come to China at all.



Yang Dali of the University of Chicago is quoted in the South China Morning Post as saying: 鈥淲e have free speech on campus, and to say these teachers are trying to indoctrinate the 19-year-old, 20-year-old students at the University of Chicago 鈥?I personally have found it to be ridiculous.鈥?


I would extend that further to argue that any experience of a foreign culture is perhaps the most important experience a young person should have. It compels you to reflect on your own beliefs; to develop compassion for other people and cultures different from your own, and is a powerful catalyst for the development of critical thinking abilities.



Furthermore, universities and the US government support US students to study in China at study abroad centres and at Chinese universities, yet US scholars are increasingly concerned at joint-institutions in their own backyard.



The China File commentators have lived, studied, worked in China, many of them at points in time where China was not as open as it is today. Several continue to travel regularly to China to lecture, give talks and to provide commentary and analysis on China鈥檚 continued transformation.



Were they subject to clumsy attempts at indoctrination when they lived in China (if so, it didn鈥檛 appear to work)? Or did this experience affect them in different ways, perhaps opening their mind, encouraging them to reflect critically on their own culture, on their own normative assumptions about how the world is, how it should be?



My own experience in China and through Chinese society and culture has brought me to question a great many of the underlying assumptions I possessed prior to living here.



It has been the greatest experience of my life, has helped me forge a career studying and teaching about a country I find endlessly fascinating; has brought me into contact with some of the warmest and most optimistic people I have ever met 鈥?including party members and officials, I should add 鈥?and has enriched my life to the greatest possible extent.



I鈥檓 pretty sure I haven鈥檛 become a Chinese Communist Party ideologue, though I believe that the successes of the party and the People鈥檚 Republic of China government over the past 35 years have undoubtedly and dramatically improved the lives of the overwhelming majority of people in China.



There are regrettable and sometimes quite painful stories that emerge on an almost daily basis, as there are emanating from the US, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. But China is moving in the right direction and continued engagement with this nation is absolutely necessary to ensure a better understanding and a brighter future.



Such engagement will undoubtedly lead to both harmony and discord over certain issues, but to withdraw from engagement through higher education would be a cataclysmic strike on Sino-US relations and would simply serve to demonstrate that US universities are as guided by ideology as those they seek to criticise; that US academics are prepared to curtail their own students鈥?opportunities on the basis of a political opinion; and that the US will not do business with anyone who doesn鈥檛 conform to its view of how the world should be 鈥?which is not necessarily how it chooses to behave itself.



We must continue to resist temptations to use commitment principles as a reason to absolve ourselves of the responsibility to further mutual understanding and respect, while acknowledging that progress cannot be achieved by self-imposed isolation or by refusal to engage.



If China is willing to send half a million of its brightest minds to overseas universities every single year, then we should not be concerned about institutes which allow our own students to experience China鈥檚 vibrant and rich culture. We should embrace them.

The last few days have seen a vibrant debate surrounding the threat posed to academic freedom by Confucius institutes in North American universities. This has been sparked by a statement from the American Association of University Professors, which determined that 鈥渁llowing any third-party control of academic matters is inconsistent with principles of academic freedom, shared governance, and the institutional autonomy of colleges and universities鈥?Perhaps (definitely) the best discussion of this issue has snowballed on the China File site.

This is true of most of the world鈥檚 oldest institutions, including Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge, St Andrews, Padua, Uppsala, Salamanca etc.They were created either by the Holy Roman Empire, the papal states or monarchs of states in which they existed, with their political allegiances placing a question mark over any claims to autonomy; Oxford, for example, remained vehemently Royalist during the English Civil War.US universities, which emerged from this tradition, can be questioned in terms of their inter-relationship with the state.Following the Soviet Union鈥檚 success with Sputnik, United States higher education went through a process not dissimilar to that which Chinese higher education is now undergoing in terms of the injection of resources into science and technology research.National Science Foundation congressional funding, for example, jumped by a factor of 15 in the decade from 1959 to 1968 鈥?from around US$35 million to US$500 million 鈥?with grants approved for research deemed to be of priority by the US government.Caltech 鈥?the California Institute of Technology 鈥?for example, grew dramatically in the post-war and Cold War era; is famous as the home of NASA鈥檚 Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and is one of America鈥檚 many universities which have Reserve Officers' Training Corps to educate commissioned officers in the US military. It is, along with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT, one of the world鈥檚 pre-eminent institutions for the furthering of scientific knowledge, yet its evolution is rooted in a close relationship with the state.The point I am making here is that universities can never be separated from the political entities in which they exist.University autonomy and academic freedom are noble values to which all universities should aspire, but there is not a single institution in the world which can lay claim to being entirely autonomous or having total academic freedom.This condition of the academy arises from the simple fact that universities derive their defining characteristics from the contexts out of which they emerge and solely at the discretion of the political entities which choose to bestow such liberties upon them and which guarantee those freedoms to a greater or lesser extent.It seems to me that we all too often uncritically accept the belief that our universities 鈥?and I include European, United Kingdom, United States and other advanced nations in this 鈥?can be or are autonomous from the state.On the contrary, they are not independent from the state, but are a civil society institution where consensus on the prevailing normative world view is negotiated.In China, all universities are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education or the provincial or municipal education bureau.There are approximately 115 national-level universities that report directly to the ministry in Beijing, while the remaining 2,190 higher education institutions are under the jurisdiction of the provincial or municipal education bureaus.Of the total 2,305 higher education institutions, 1,090 are involved in four-year degree provision, with a smaller proportion approved for masters and doctoral degrees, while the remaining 1,215 provide three-year vocational diploma education. None of these universities confer their own degrees as all degrees in China are conferred by the Ministry of Education.Institutions receive their funding directly from the Ministry of Education or education bureau for teaching, with the leading universities competing for research funds from different government departments including the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education and other national ministries and provincial governments.All Chinese universities work to deliver research that contributes to national, provincial and local development goals as laid out in the five-year plans at various different levels of government.China has a much greater recognition of the social function of the university and chooses not to cover up this fact, but rather to emphasise the central importance of higher education to national social, economic, cultural and political development.Personally, I find this not to be insidious, but to be quite acutely and refreshingly realistic about the social function of the university and its relationship with the state.It might not reflect my thinking on how a higher education sector should be, but as an academic I'm interested in understanding China's higher education sector on its own terms, with the hope of being better able to understand how it will continue to transform.To criticise China's higher education system for not adhering to the same principles of autonomy and (arguably) academic freedom would serve only to identify me as viewing China as a problem to be solved and that, I strongly argue, is an uncritical perspective which tells people more about my normative convictions than it does about the Chinese higher education system.When conducting my doctoral research, I interviewed many Chinese university presidents, party secretaries and senior officials and academics 鈥?both formally and informally 鈥?which revealed the scale of this industrial policy approach to the higher education sector.One particular quote stood out in my mind and serves to highlight the difference in attitudes towards higher education:鈥溾€ur logic is not the same as their [Western] logic鈥estern logic holds that the university wants to be the smartest group of people in the world, right. If I have my opinion, if I think we should educate students in certain subjects, this is completely the right of the university [to decide]. The university鈥檚 right is paramount. But Chinese universities鈥hey have never been like this; [it鈥檚 about] what contribution can I make鈥?At first, such a statement appears to serve to highlight the differences between Chinese and 鈥榃estern鈥?higher education. But I believe it is more useful to jettison the assumption prevalent in the West that universities can be autonomous. (I emphasise here that I think we should strive for that, but that it is not achievable).It is here where I believe that Gramsci鈥檚 notion of the integral state, as a sum of political society and civil society, is extremely useful in framing the relationship between the state and higher education, regardless of national context.Gramsci defines political society in a manner simi"

"TANZANIA China inaugurates Confucius institute, builds library Tweet



The development at the country鈥檚 oldest higher education institution came barely six months after the University of Dodoma signed an agreement with the Zhengzhou Institute of Aeronautical Industry Management to establish a Confucius institute.



University of Dar es Salaam, or UDSM, Vice-chancellor Professor Rwekaza Mukandala said language courses at the new institute would be offered by Chinese Zhejian Normal University, which was previously running an evening programme and a Chinese Summer Camp.



He was speaking at the launch by the two universities of a Confucius institute at the main Mwalimu Julius Nyerere campus in Dar es Salaam.



The evening programme had been very successful, Mukandala said, with 60 out of 68 learners in the last cohort completing the three-month course. 鈥淲e need to take this initiative to another level,鈥?he observed.



There would now be more courses, including in basic Chinese language, Chinese listening skills, oral Chinese skills, Chinese songs, a Taiji course, Chinese calligraphy and traditional Chinese painting.



The new Confucius institute had already submitted the course outlines for senate approval, the vice-chancellor said. Undergraduate students would be the first to benefit from initial courses in Chinese language and culture.



鈥淥nce the course outlines are approved, UDSM students can choose to study Chinese language intensively from level one to level six within one year.鈥?


Mukandala also announced that the Chinese government had agreed to build a modern library that would cost 26 billion shillings (US$16 million) and be able to accommodate some 5,000 students. Construction would be completed within a year.



China would also build a secondary school at the main campus that would be used as a demonstration institution by the Dar es Salaam University College of Education.



For its part, UDSM is planning to introduce Kiswahili training at various universities in China.



In his remarks, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Bernard Membe called on Tanzanians to make good use of the institute and learn from the ideas that had made China an economic giant.



鈥淭he Confucius institute will be a bridge to unite the people of the countries of Tanzania and China,鈥?Membe said, adding that the institute would also help unlock business and trade cooperation.



Good relations



Recent years have seen a growth in partnerships between the two nations, with the Chinese now controlling large swathes of the Tanzanian economy in areas ranging from construction to small trading. There are also many Tanzanians involved in trade with Hong Kong.



Among African countries, Tanzania enjoys particularly close ties with Beijing.



South Africa鈥檚 ties with China are also tight, on account of both countries being in the BRICS 鈥?Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa 鈥?group. However competition between China and South Africa for trade and economic deals across Africa is fierce.



Zimbabwe and Sudan are unambiguously close to China. Both countries have depended on the counterweight of China to survive their categorisation as rogue states.



In Tanzania鈥檚 case, multi-layered connections with China are not motivated by dire circumstances that necessitate a 鈥榣ook East鈥?policy.



The special relationship came about partly because Tanzania 鈥?unlike neighbouring Kenya and some other African nations 鈥?took a socialist path post-independence and was therefore on the same wavelength as China鈥檚 Communist Party.



In the 1970s, China built the 1,800-kilometre Tanzania-Zambia railway. During a state visit to Tanzania last March, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete signed at least 19 agreements reportedly worth more than US$6 billion.

"ZIMBABWE Award-winning Confucius institute first in world to have local lecturers Tweet



Speaking at the award ceremony this month, Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Lin Lin said the Confucius institute in the capital Harare started in 2006 with only 30 students but now has 700. He added that it was helping to spread Chinese culture.



The origins of the Confucius institute can be traced to President Robert Mugabe鈥檚 鈥楲ook East鈥?policy, adopted after Western countries slapped sanctions on him and his inner circle in the wake of bloody 2002 presidential elections.



Since then Western countries have denied study visas to the children of Mugabe鈥檚 鈥榣ieutenants鈥? with Australia going as far as expelling those already studying there.



China has filled the gap and it, together with Russia, opposed further sanctions at the United Nations, thereby thwarting actions that could have seen Mugabe toppled in the same manner as Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.



As a result, Mugabe sees the Asian giant as an all-weather friend and these good relations have seen the Confucius institute thrive, with even Mugabe鈥檚 wife, Grace, learning the Chinese language.



The Chinese award, though only announced at the University of Zimbabwe this month, was received in December at the annual international Confucius institute conference held in Beijing.



鈥淭he award was recognition for outstanding performance in teaching the Chinese language and culture, training local Chinese teachers, promoting student exchange etc,鈥?read a statement released at the Zimbabwe ceremony.



鈥淭here were more than 400 Confucius institutes from more than 100 universities attending the conference of 2,100 delegates from all over the world.



鈥淔rom the African region, only the Confucius institute at the University of Zimbabwe and the Confucius institute at Suez Canal University received this highly esteemed and coveted award.鈥?


Further, the statement said, the Zimbabwean institute was the only one in the world that by July this year would have seven local lecturers with formal training in teaching Chinese as a foreign language, after obtaining masters in teaching Chinese from Chinese universities. The seven lecturers were granted scholarships by the Chinese government.



The university also said it had received a commendation from the Chinese government for having completed its first five-year plan and having formulated another plan from 2012-16 that will, among other things, guarantee teaching and lay the foundation for the cascading of teaching of the Chinese language from primary school to university.



Grace Mugabe plans to introduce Chinese at a primary school that she founded and which opened its doors this month. In 2007, the First Lady enrolled at the People's University of China to learn the Chinese language. Later she took advantage of the Confucius institute and had professors sent to her home to teach her.

The University of Zimbabwe Confucius institute is set to become the only one in the world with local lecturers, at a time when it has received an award for being the best in Sub-Saharan Africa.Speaking at the award ceremony this month, Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Lin Lin said the Confucius institute in the capital Harare started in 2006 with only 30 students but now has 700.

"Harare's little Shanghai: A boom in Chinese restaurants indicates China's growth in Zimbabwe.

Five years ago, the Chinese-language class opened with two lecturers and only a dozen students.

Today, it bears the lofty name ""the Confucius institute at the University of Zimbabwe"" and is virtually beating away applicants with a stick.

The institute now uses five classrooms for more than 700 students and continues to field hundreds of applications.

""The institute is in the process of engaging the government to incorporate Chinese in school syllabi,"" said director Pedzisai Mashiri.

So successful has the institute been that Mashiri said it was working at getting students at Chinese universities to take up Shona as a foreign language.

Mashiri said 14 Zimbabwean students were studying for master's degrees in Chinese at a university in China and seven Zimbabwean lecturers were on one-year scholarships from the Chinese government and would graduate this July.

Students at the Confucius institute learn subjects such as ""Chinese for tourism"" and ""Chinese for managers"", essential subjects in a country whose economy is increasingly tying its fortunes to Beijing's rising star.

Last year, academic Mandivamba Rukuni ran a popular seminar on ""learning the skills necessary to become an effective negotiator with the Chinese"". The $1 000 fee did not deter participants.

When the lessons in the Chinese language began, they mostly served government bureaucrats. Now businesspeople, from heads of large corporations to small-time traders, want to learn the language.

""It is not only for my trips to Shanghai, but important for business here at home. There are a lot of Chinese people here that we interact with,"" said Jossie Dube, who enrolled at the school last year.

The language is not only being taught at university level.

Last week, first lady Grace Mugabe opened the Amai Mugabe Junior School in Mazowe, where 100 students will learn Mandarin as one of their subjects. Grace claims to speak and write Chinese. The school was built for her by the Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Company, the same enterprise that constructed the Zimbabwe Defence College just outside Harare.

Growing Chinese influence

A boom in Chinese restaurants also points to China's growing economic influence.

At the Great Wall Chinese restaurant in Harare's Belgravia suburb, getting a table for lunch is tough.

The restaurant is popular among the Harare who's who.

Early this week a group of members of Parliament held a raucous lunch there on the day it sat to debate the proposed new constitution.

Strikes at Chinese-owned companies are frequent and workers often complain of low pay and allege physical abuse.

Han Bing, the head of the economic and commercial consul at the Chinese embassy, admitted that the cultural gap between China and Zimbabwe was a source of conflict between the newly arrived Chinese and locals. Yet some aspects of the Chinese lifestyle have lots of takers, especially among the rich.

At the end of a narrow and steep tree-lined avenue in Harare's wealthy Glen Lorne area, a local woman runs a thriving exclusive spa for the rich, hawking Chinese herbs, diet plans and therapeutic exercise.

She declined to have her name or the name of her spa published, arguing that, ""once too many people know, my clients will stop coming here"".

For hundreds of dollars, rich people learn the ways of the qing dan diet and tai chi. She imports herbs from China and employs two Chinese ""acupuncture experts"".

""People come here to release tension. They are busy and sometimes they need to bring their balance back,"" the proprietor said. She declined to say whether her treatments were legal.

New mall

In Harare's Belvedere, soldiers 鈥?and large golden dragon sculptures 鈥?stand guard over the entrance to the Long Cheng Plaza, a new mall being built by Anjin, another Chinese company.

The mall is being built over marshland, angering environmentalists, who warn that it would one day damage Harare's water supply.

The mall is owned by Anjin, whose joint venture with a Zimbabwe military-affiliated company in the Marange diamond fields explains why soldiers guard the complex.

The mall is having to delay its scheduled April opening after it was flooded, and the state Environmental Management Authority said this justified its opposition to the building.

But despite the controversy and rentals for some of the larger stores reportedly reaching $3 000 a month, according to property agents, all the shops have been taken up.

Agents say the bulk of the tenants are new arrivals from China."
"KENYA KENYA: Cashing in on foreign language learning Tweet Kenya's universities are rolling out foreign language programmes as nations and investors, especially from Asia, increasingly turn to the East African country for resources to boost their industrial growth. In the past month Kenya's biggest universities - Nairobi and Kenyatta - have announced new courses in Korean and Chinese respectively. They both host branches of China's Confucius institute.



The new language courses have added impetus to a trend that is influencing Kenya's higher education sector, with key foreign languages seen as tools of global commerce and thus of growing importance to the country and to university graduates.



A spot-check by University World News also revealed rising enrolments in colleges offering foreign languages as Kenyans seek competitive advantages in getting jobs, with students seeking out languages like Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Spanish and French.



The foreign language learning trend has emerged as demand for higher education and student enrolments soar, and competition between universities for students heats up. As a result, educationists said, programmes are becoming more diversified and the number of institutions is growing.



""Education is becoming a lucrative sector in Kenya,"" said Samuel Owuor, an education consultant in Nairobi, and countries are using higher education to boost business and trade interests. ""That coupled with the desire by learners to become all-round professionals who can work in any country and environment, explains the growing appetite for foreign languages.""



The University of Nairobi last month became the first in the region to launch a programme in the Korean language. Its foreign language courses also include Chinese, French and German. The university and the Academy of Korean Studies signed a memorandum for a five-year partnership that includes cooperation in research, and exchanges of academic materials, staff and students.



A Confucius institute was launched at the University of Nairobi in 2005, which officials said was attracting considerable numbers of students. There are now plans for the institute to start offering a four-year degree course at the university.



With China spreading its wings in Africa, the economic giant is reaching out to universities to teach Chinese as a tool of trade. It has been using the Confucius institute model to penetrate nations where language has been a barrier to commerce. Chinese diplomats in Kenya say there are more than 320 Confucius institutes in 82 countries, including 13 in Africa.



Three weeks ago, the Confucius institute and Kenyatta University launched a partnership that will promote Chinese language learning and cultural and educational exchange programmes between the two countries.



""The objective of the institute is to promote the culture of the two countries by breaking language barriers,"" said Wang Gang, Vice-chairman of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a member of the political bureau of the Communist Party of China, during the launch of the institute at Kenyatta University.



""With globalisation, it is prudent for countries to learn the language of others in order to promote communication, understanding and further friendship,"" he added.



Kenyatta University's Chinese programme involves China's Shangdong Normal University. Kenyatta's deputy Vice-chancellor, Professor Paul Wainaina, said the university would waive payment for beginners enrolling in Chinese language and culture courses. He urged Kenyans to take advantage of the opportunity.



Companies from China, and from India, are boosting their presence in Kenya through multi-million shilling acquisition deals, with an eye on lucrative sectors such as telecommunication, tourism, energy, technology, commodities and construction.



The volume of trade with China is booming. Over the past six years, imports from China have risen from Sh6 billion to Sh35 billion (US$0.43 billion), according to the government's Economic Survey 2010, though Kenya's exports to China remain under Sh2 billion.



""The launch of the Confucius institute of China is a step forward in strengthening bilateral ties between Kenya and China,"" said Kenya's Vice-president Kalonzo Musyoka. ""This will go a long way in promoting tourism between the two countries.""



It is not only China that has been reaching out to Kenya through language. European giants such as France and Germany have also been using education to make imprints in the region, with an eye at growing trade and investment.



Arabic is also gaining ground as more Kenyans head to Dubai and Saudi Arabia to work, as well as to Sudan for emerging business opportunities.



As with English, French is already strong in Africa. It is spoken in as many as 30 African countries and is deeply entrenched as an official language in Francophone countries.



Leading universities in Kenya including Nairobi, Moi, Maseno and Kenyatta have added French to their curricula as pressure mounts on them to offer courses that are in tandem with market needs and as they seek to expand their student registers.



With the integration process in East Africa rapidly becoming a reality - last month a common market for the region was launched, encouraging the flow of labour, goods and services around East Africa - investors in Kenya are looking for people who can speak several languages.



This is especially so with French, a key language in Rwanda and Burundi - two French-speaking countries seen as growth frontiers by Kenyan companies keen to expand their business horizons beyond the national boarders.

In South Africa there are Confucius institutes, named after China's most famous philosopher, at Rhodes University, Tshwane University of Technology and Stellenbosch University. Across Southern Africa, there are institutes at the University of Zimbabwe, the University of Botswana and the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar.



The newest institute last month began offering free Chinese classes to University of Cape Town students through an agreement between the institution and the Chinese Hanban, the Chinese Language International Office.



Professor Wu Qianlong, deputy director of the Confucius institute at the university, said it would be involved in providing credit-bearing Chinese courses taught through the school of languages and literatures, and in promoting Chinese culture among Cape Town communities. Courses would eventually become available to the public.



Qianlong said the courses could benefit students considerably. ""For those who are really committed to learning Chinese, the reward is obvious: this can give them an edge when entering the world of an economic powerhouse and exposing them to a mixture of West and East cultures,"" he said.



Matthew Macdonald, a research analyst with the Centre of Chinese Studies at Stellenbosch University, agreed that the teaching and learning of Chinese augured well for easier business dealings as the Asian partnership with African higher education institutions grows.



""Any education, any skills transfer that happens in between China and South Africa or anywhere in the Southern Africa Development Community, will promote progress in development,"" Macdonald told University World News.



China recently became South Africa's largest trading partner and South Africa is now China's second largest trade partner, according to the official Xinhau News Agency.



South African President Jacob Zuma recently returned from a visit to China with a 300-strong business delegation. Bilateral trade between the two in the first half of this year reached US$10.81 billion, up 56.1% year on year, officials reported.



In the January edition of China Monitor Professor Scarlett Cornelissen, interim director of the Centre for Chinese Studies at Stellenbosch, wrote that given China's increased economic and diplomatic presence in Africa, Confucius institutes could ""play a key complementary role to enhance collaboration, exchange and knowledge"".



In a report the same bulletin Marius Vermaak, director of the Confucius institute at Rhodes University - launched in August 2008 - said despite what cynics might think about the Chinese, space was for the development of distinctively African Confucius institutes.



With weak higher education systems and a growing demand for university education that could not be satisfied on the continent, ""for the foreseeable future many students from Africa will have to look at educational opportunities in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and, more and more so, in China,"" Vermaak wrote.



A total of 25 Confucius institutes have been opened in 18 African countries over the years. In June, Kenya's biggest universities - Nairobi and Kenyatta, which both host Confucius institute branches - announced new courses in Korean and Chinese respectively.



The 10th International Chinese Language Teaching Seminar held in Shenyang last month revealed that worldwide Chinese was being studied at more than 300 Confucius institutes and more than 300 Confucius Classrooms in 94 countries. China is bridging the cultural gap between itself and Southern Africa through Confucius institutes, the newest teaching Mandarin - simplified traditional Chinese - to students at the University of Cape Town. There are now 25 institutes across Africa, including four in South Africa, where China has become the largest trading partner.In South Africa there are Confucius institutes, named after China's most famous philosopher, at Rhodes University, Tshwane University of Technology and Stellenbosch University.

"Chiemelie Ezeobi reports that the recently held Chinese New Year Anniversary was an opportunity to examine the thriving cultural relationship between Nigeria and China while positing a way forward to ensure an enduring mutually beneficial and symbiotic partnership

For the Chinese, their New Year Festival is often commemorated as a very big deal. According to Wikipedia, the Chinese New Year is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunisolar and solar Chinese calendar.

This year, it was marked on February 1 and was tagged the 鈥淵ear of the Tiger鈥? Across the world, the Chinese community mark this festival with pomp. In Lagos, Nigeria, it was not different.

Organised and hosted by the Huaxing Arts Troupe Nigeria Limited at Oriental Hotel in Lagos, it brought together the Chinese community and stakeholders.

Speaking on the topic: 鈥楶romoting Friendships between Nigeria and China: The Benefits, Expectations, Challenges and the Way Forward鈥? the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the importance of promoting friendship between Nigeria and China cannot be overemphasised.

He said apart from the very strategic relations between the governments of these two countries, the need for the promotion of friendship between their citizens is even more compelling for the fact that China has the largest community of foreign nationals in Nigeria.

Represented by the Director General of the Centre for Black and African Arts and Civilisation (CBAAC), Hon. Oluwabunmi Amao, the minister said it is the consensus of opinion among scholars of International relations that the relationship between the two countries dates back to the 15th Century, but it was not until 10th February, 1971 that relations between China and Nigeria was formalised with the establishment of diplomatic ties and the opening of embassies in each other鈥檚 country within the same year.

With over five decades of international relations, the China-Nigeria Relations are in the areas of: politics, trade, investment, aid, technology, science, culture, education, health and military.

Economic Cooperation

On the economic benefits of Nigeria-China Relations, Amao said: 鈥淏oth countries have increasingly realised the importance of economic cooperation between them.鈥?
Adding that Nigeria has tapped into its technical assistance in the development of its infrastructures, she said China too has tapped into Nigeria鈥檚 oil and gas sector to fuel its growing industry.

鈥淚n addition, Nigeria has proven to be the largest market for China鈥檚 industrial products in Africa such Textiles, Pharmaceuticals thus accounting for over a third of its total trade with West Africa.

鈥淎lthough accurate figures are difficult to find, it is believed that Nigeria-China trade moved from about $1.8 billion in 2003 to $13.5 billion in 2018. In this process, more Nigerians have equally established business and other relationships in China.

鈥淕oing by indices at the level of Economic relations, the volume of bilateral trade between the two countries have been valued at over $50 billion in the last three years. There are about 218 Chinese companies in Nigeria and are all actively engaged in the various sectors of the economy.鈥?
Infrastructural Cooperation and Development

On this she acquiesced that 鈥渋t is true that China鈥檚 relationship with Nigeria has helped the country Infrastructure-wise.

鈥淚n specific terms, one major area of the Chinese strategic relationship with Nigeria is the building of rail infrastructure which is gradually positioning Nigeria as a modern economy with infrastructural foundation.

鈥淚n recent years, the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) has delivered four major railway projects after completion, all with a total stretch of 712km, a huge economic value that has been added to the country.

鈥淭he CCECC has proven over time to be a reliable supporter of infrastructure upgrade and creation for the economy of Nigeria.

Nigeria has benefited from a number of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. Notable ones include the Abuja/Kaduna Standard Gauge Rail Line linking the nation鈥檚 capital Abuja to Kaduna, a trade centre and transportation hub in North-Western Nigeria, the Lagos/Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail Line linking Lagos, Nigeria鈥檚 economic capital to Ibadan, the former administrative capital of southwestern Nigeria, and the Lagos/Kano railway, which is an ambitious project connecting the two most populous cities in Southern and Northern Nigeria. Others include new International Airport terminals in Abuja, Port Harcourt and Kano.

Cultural and Educational Cooperation/Exchanges

The fields of Culture and Education are some of the areas that have featured prominently in the friendship between China and Nigeria.

As of 2019, Nigeria had the highest number of African students studying in China; there were about 6,800 Nigerian students in various fields many of whom received scholarships from the Chinese Government.

Culturally, even though China and Nigeria have vastly different historical experiences and cultural traditions, China has been remarkably successful in its efforts to promote Chinese culture in Nigeria, and Nigeria also benefitting in like manner.

Student exchanges and the increase of Chinese media in Nigeria have been the primary mechanisms behind the increasing cultural synergy between the two countries.

鈥淔or example in 2007, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Akwa, Nigeria, established a Confucius institute to teach the Chinese language to Nigerian students. Some years later, the University of Lagos followed suit.

鈥淭he Confucius institute is a non-profit making organisation that promotes the teaching of Chinese language and culture. It was founded as a cooperation between the Beijing Institute of Technology and some Nigerian Universities.

鈥淎s business linkages between China and Nigeria have grown rapidly in recent years, the institute has been acclaimed as a successful project (Samuel Ramani, 2016).

鈥淚ts success was acknowledged on June 29, 2016 when the Chinese Embassy in Abuja announced the establishment of Nigeria鈥檚 first Chinese Cultural Research Center.

鈥淭he embassy also pledged to create an Igbo language institute in China to encourage Chinese university graduates to work for Chinese companies in Nigeria.鈥?
Blossoming Cuisines

Another very significant area the friendship between Nigeria and China has blossomed is in the area of cuisines with the presence of several Chinese restaurants across the Nation.

鈥淚n Lagos State alone, there are not less than 50 Chinese restaurants across board which enjoys a high level of patronage from both Nigerians and Chinese expatriates.

鈥淎buja and Lagos have also played host to the Spring Festival Temple Fair at different points in time. This have in no small way deepened the cultural relationship between both countries.鈥?She disclosed.

Military Cooperation and Assistance

Military cooperation is yet another area of friendship that is of huge significance.

According to Amao, at some point when a number of advanced nations of the world denied the sales of Military equipment and support to Nigeria, the Chinese offered to fill the void by selling Military aircraft, like fighter jets which the Nigerian Air force have been using to prosecute the war on terror as well as some Naval warships which have boosted Nigerian Navy鈥檚 operations in the nations鈥?maritime domain.

鈥淭hey have also assisted in supplying military technology and sending military trainers to assist Nigerian forces in their counter-insurgency efforts.

鈥淎dditionally, in 2019, China donated about N2billion to Nigeria to support the fight against insurgency. This was in fulfilment of part of the military-to-military cooperation consummated between the two countries during their bilateral agreements and MoU on peace and security in 2018.

鈥淣o doubt, these actions reaffirmed the Nigeria-China friendship and have contributed greatly to Nigerian鈥檚 positive perceptions of China,鈥?she added.

Broadening Cultural, People-to-People Exchanges

On the need for both countries to broaden cultural, and people-to-people exchanges to deepen their traditional friendship, she noted that 鈥渢he two countries need to take into consideration the growing enthusiasm of their people for interactions; encourage friendly exchanges in Education, Culture, Health, Science and Technology, Media and other fields, and increase people-to-people exchanges to cement the social foundation for China-Nigeria friendship.

鈥淐onsequently, China and Nigeria must make use of the platforms to increase mutual visits by Central and Local Governments, Art troupes (like the Huaxing Arts Troupe) and Academic groups as well as other exchanges at all levels and in all fields.

鈥淔or example, people-to-people and cultural exchanges between Nigeria and China are still areas with huge and untapped potential.

鈥淚 wish to assure the Chinese Government and its people that Nigeria鈥檚 Federal Ministry of Information and Culture is fully committed to ensuring that culture is properly harnessed to contribute its quota in promoting friendship and cooperation between the two countries.鈥?
FESTAC鈥?7 @45

Whilst speaking, Amao chipped in that the Centre for Black and African Arts and Civilisation (CBAAC), a parastatal of the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture has commenced preparation to commemorate the 45th Anniversary of Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC鈥?7@45).

鈥淏eing the Organisation established after (FESTAC鈥?7), CBAAC is in custody of all the materials including Artefacts, Art Works, Footages of Performances and all other collections exhibited by the 59 Black and African Countries that participated in FESTAC鈥?7.

鈥淔ESTAC鈥?7 @ 45 is designed to be a weeklong event packed with activities to showcase diverse cultural expressions and entertainment which include Music, Dance, Poetry, Folklore, Drama, traditional Cuisines/Food Fair, Arts and Craft Exhibitions, Cultural Variety Night etc.

鈥淭his would afford artists and culture practitioners on both the African Continent, the Diaspora as well as other countries of the world the platform to promote and encourage their diverse creative expressions/elements, products and art forms.

鈥淲e have since commenced the preparation with a number of stakeholders including UNESCO, the African Union Commission and its members states.

鈥淲e therefore wish to invite the Chinese Government and community to be part of this Cultural Fiesta to once again cement bones of friendship that is already existing between Nigeria and China,鈥?she disclosed.

Challenges of Nigeria 鈥?China Relations

In spite of the successes recorded as a result of the friendship and bilateral relations established by the two countries, Amao said it was not without some challenges.

She said: 鈥淚t is important to note that the relationship has not entirely been a smooth sail with many Nigerians believing that it is no longer a Win-Win situation as claimed by China.

鈥淔irstly, there is the well circulated notion of Chinese manufacturers colluding with some Nigerian traders to produce cheap but inferior products especially pharmaceutical products, textiles, electronics, footwear etc.

鈥淣igeria-China history is marked by solidarity, but also dented by Old and New racism. For example, in April 2020, a video emerged online of a Nigerian diplomat in China, Razaq Lawal, publicly criticising his compatriots鈥?maltreatment in Guangzhou by Chinese officials in the wake of COVID-19 Pandemic. It would be recalled this caused a diplomatic uproar between the two nations.鈥?
Sustaining an Enduring Relationship

But beyond that, stressing that both countries have had an enduring relationship, she said that as they have both come a long way 鈥渋t is safe to conclude that the two countries are on an enduring relationship that is daily blossoming and growing to a huge bilateral synergy built on strong mutual benefits.

鈥淐hina鈥檚 investment in Africa and by extension Nigeria is phenomenal and has over time progressively transformed into Africa鈥檚 largest trading partner surpassing traditional partners such as Europe and the United States of America.

鈥淎s it is, there is need for concerted efforts by both countries to ensure that gains of the friendship that have been recorded continue to blossom鈥?

Way Forward

Positing the way forward, Amao said 鈥淎part from what is already established, the two countries have huge potential for investment cooperation, which is highly complementary, especially in the field of energy, resources, and infrastructure. There is a need to develop and tap this cooperation鈥檚 potential.鈥?
Quote

鈥淭he two countries need to take into consideration the growing enthusiasm of their people for interactions; encourage friendly exchanges in Education, Culture, Health, Science and Technology, Media and other fields, and increase people-to-people exchanges to cement the social foundation for China-Nigeria friendship鈥?

"By Enyeribe Ejiogu ([email protected])

With academic excellence, dedication and commitment to purpose, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, NAU, is doggedly pursuing its vision to be among the top 200 universities in the world. In a clear demonstration of come-from-the-back success, it has become the Third Most Sought After University among all federal, state and private universities in Nigeria. More importantly, its global ranking from 4497 three years ago to 2988 in June 2022.

Through his simple style of leadership over the past three years, the Vice Chancellor, Prof Okechukwu Esimone who was ranked 18th on the list of 28 Most Published Scholars in Nigeria in global high impact factor journals is inspiring academic staff to consistently pursue scholarship and intellectual excellence. Under his leadership, NAU is raking in academic grants from national and international sources as well as establishing very beneficial collaborations with notable Nigerian corporates and other organisations. ,In this interview, he sheds more light on the quantum leap NAU has recorded in the past three years and gives indication of anticipated achievements in the remaining two years of his tenure, to build on the solid foundation laid for attainment of the institution鈥檚 vision.

Nnamdi Azikiwe University has maintained a close relationship with the Confucius institute. Why was China chosen for this collaboration instead of other similar socio-cultural institutes in Germany, Japan, South Korea, among other countries?

First, I want to say that we did not choose China. Rather, they chose us. The Confucius institutes are outlets for exchange of knowledge on Chinese culture. A lot of people wrongly think that the institute is just about the learning of Mandarin, the Chinese language. If you understand the culture of a people, you will relate far and better with them. In essence, it is an institute that tries to teach Chinese culture and the language.

Usually, the Chinese headquarters of the Confucius institute invites applications from tertiary institutions and the organisations select educational institutions based on certain criteria. In 2008, Nnamdi Azikiwe University was chosen to host a branch of the Confucius institute. There are only two branches in the whole of Nigeria 鈥?Unizik and University of Lagos. Fortunately that of Nnamdi Azikiwe University has become a trailblazer not only in Nigerian, but Africa and the world. We have won several national and international awards, including the African Champions Award and the world. In the last competition, students from the Confucius institute, Unizik, were able to beat native Chinese in spoken and written mandarin because we have the best of teachers. We have been able to understudy and deploy the judging criteria, so we impart that to our students, and that is how we have been able to emerge as one of the top Confucius institutes in the world. From our sterling performance, the Chinese have said the choice of NAU to host the Confucius institute was not a wrong one.

To what can you attribute the success of the institute?

I can say that it has everything to do with the Igbo trait of exhibiting excellence at all times. That is what is at the very core. The Igbo spirit is the spirit of excellence; spirit of survival of the fittest. That鈥檚 what we put into it. Actually, we deployed the survival instinct, business entrepreneurial skill and inert trait of excellence in the Igbo man to run the Confucius institute. And it has paid off. In the course of the relationship, we have also exported our own culture to them, because it cannot be a one-way traffic. As they teach us Chinese, we teach them Igbo. We now have Chinese nationals who are coming to Unizik to study Igbo. Today, we have Igbo cultural exchange programmes, Igbo philosophy and theatre which we are exploring. Not too long ago, a product of the Confucius institute, Emmanuel Ikechukwu Umeonyirioha, went to China to study and from there he was engaged as the first lecturer in the newly established Department of Igbo Language at Oxford University, Britain.

When you were appointed three years ago, what goals did you set out to achieve and how far have you gone towards achieving them?

I set out with a mantra that is known within the entire Nnamdi Azikiwe University (Unizik) system. It is called Project 200, which has the vision-mission of doing things that would enable us rise to be among the first 200 universities in the world, the first 10 universities in Africa and number in Nigeria. That goal was predicated on five pillars jointly known by the acronym, ACADA, to enable people remember them. The 鈥楢鈥?stands for academic excellence, so as to be nationally and globally relevant; C- for community service which is what universities are supposed to do; the second 鈥楢鈥?stands for administrative reforms; D- stands for discipline 鈥?the reason things are not done properly in Nigeria is because there is no discipline. We strongly believe that discipline should be embedded in our DNA code, to become one of the top 200 universities in the world; the last 鈥楢鈥?stands for advancements in every facet of the university system 鈥?in terms of infrastructure, security, quality, welfare, academic programmes and in every other area of work done by my predecessors, and to generally build on the achievements made by them and take them further.

Looking at the pillars individually, we have accomplished a lot. We noticed that the universities that are highly rated are known for academic excellence. The way to rate academic excellence in a university is to first look at publications. The ranking of a university depends on where their academic staff are publishing or the kind of scholarship they are known for as well as the kind of research grants they attract. So if you look at just those two 鈥?research grants and publications (there are several other parameters), we realised that in order to get our people published in high impact factor journals, there are two things you need to do. First, you have to educate them on how to do good research and secondly, you need to incentivise it. In South Africa for instance, incentives are attached to being published in a high impact factor journal. If you publish in such journals the university bears the cost of getting published. That is what is done in the United States and in Europe where I did my postdoctoral work. If you publish in high impact factor journals, where the cost is between US$1000-2000, you don鈥檛 bother about how you will pay for it 鈥?university pays because it is happy that you are promoting the institution and contributing to its ranking. But in Nigeria, it is the researcher that bears the financial burden of publishing his research findings. To change the paradigm, we incentivised it and took away the burden and assured them that if they publish in high impact factor journals the university would pay. This change spurred them and they started striving to get published, especially those who previously had phobia, probably because of cost. We did a lot of training and capacity building. We brought experts to teach them on how to do research works that can be published in high impact factor journals. The outcome was that we started seeing a surge of research works. We also subtly included this as part of the assessment guidelines for promotions. Our people in all faculties know the guidelines. So the awareness rocketed up and a lot of the academic staffs are now publishing. And this has enhanced the ranking of the university and the same thing with grants. Universities are known all over the world over by the quality and scope of grants senior lecturers, authors and researchers attract from organisations, corporate bodies and notable foundations. People are working to attract grants. Where I trained abroad, the ability of the institution to retain you in a particular department or as a professor depends on how many high value research grants you have attracted, but in Nigeria it is not like that. So, we established a unit in charge of research grants, to teach people how to write proposals for research grants.

The outcome has been phenomenal. That same year we started it, for the first time we got seven national research grants from Tertiary Education Tax Fund (TETFUND), ranging from N20-40 million. Before we could not even scratch one. Since then, our people have been winning grants. One of our staff is currently in Harvard University working on a research project based on a grant he got. There are those in other Ivy League universities in the United States. We have a team coordinating a grant from the World Health Organisation; that had never happened before in this institution.

These heart-warming developments have placed us among the global ranking. Our ranking has been enhanced. When I came onboard in 2019, we were at 4497 in world ranking. But by the last time I checked, we had moved up. In January 2021 we ranked 4773 in the world, 110 in Africa and 33 in Nigeria. One yera later in January 2022, our ranking improved, rising to 3464 in the world and 18 in Nigeria. By June 2022, the ranking of Unizik made further improvemt, rising to 2988 in the world, 53 in Africa and 12 in Nigeria, from where it was six months earlier. That tells you that the efforts we are making to actualise the vision is yielding very positive results.

Recently, I attended a policy meeting of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, and saw that we have become the third most sought after university, that is based on JAMB statistics of the number of students applying for admission into Nnamdi Azikiwe University. Before we were number 10 in Nigeria. Despite the insecurity in the state, which is a big minus, you still see that people want to associate or affiliate with us, both from within the nation and internationally. For instance, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, wants to affiliate with us.

In terms of community service, we have started a radio programme where departments and special units tell people in Anambra State about Unizik innovations and services that can offered to the public, to solve various problems in the society 鈥?that is another form of town-and-gown initiative."
"By Kest茅r Kenn Klomeg芒h

Russian Presidential Special Representative for the Middle East and Africa, Mikhail Bogdanov, in an April interview with Interfax news agency, offered an insight into aspects of Russia鈥檚 policy objectives, initiatives and future prospects in Africa.

He highlighted a few obstacles to the Russian government鈥檚 inability in realizing its set goals and tasks during the past several years. But what is spectacularly interesting in the interview text concerns Soviet and Russian education for Africans.

Bogdanov authoritatively told the interviewer, Ksenia Baygarova, that Africa has always been an important region from the point of view of the foreign policy of the Russian Federation.

鈥淭his cooperation is very multi-dimensional. For instance, how many Africans have studied at our universities? Back at the end of the 1950s-1960s, the Soviet Union played the most important historical role for African peoples in getting their statehood and independence during their fight against colonial rule. Of course, these historical ties give a solid basis for cordial relationships. Many generations of politicians and diplomats have changed but it is good that continuity and solidarity between our country and Africa have been upheld,鈥?he narrated about the past historical records.

Understandably, now is the time for creating the foundation for the restoration of Russia-African ties after a certain pause which was mainly linked to domestic problems in the country. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, other problems emerged and they pushed cooperation with Africa into the background. 鈥淪ome of our embassies in African countries were closed. Regrettably, much has been lost over this period, and as they say, nature abhors a vacuum. Others, western countries, China, Turkey, and India, filled the vacuum that emerged after our 鈥榬etreat鈥?from Africa,鈥?he convincingly explained.

Monitoring, researching and analyzing the post-Soviet developments in Africa with information resources on official Russia鈥檚 Ministry of Foreign Affairs website indicated that during the past years, there have been several top-level bilateral meetings. The overwhelming truth is that some of the information pointed to the signing of MoUs and bilateral agreements, at least during the past decade. In November 2021, a policy document titled the 鈥楽ituation Analytical Report鈥?presented at the premises of TASS News Agency was very critical of Russia鈥檚 current policy towards Africa.

While the number of high-level meetings has increased, the share of substantive issues on the agenda remains small. There are few definitive results from such meetings. Apart from the absence of a public strategy for the continent, at the same time, there is a lack of coordination among various state and para-state institutions working with Africa. Many bilateral agreements, at the top and high political levels, have still not been implemented. A lot more important issues have received little attention since the first African leaders鈥?summit held in Sochi.

In addition to the above, our monitoring and research show Russia grossly lacks public outreach policies that could help form good perception and build an image, especially among the youth and the middle class that form the bulk of Africa鈥檚 1.3 billion population.

Researchers have been making tangible contributions to the development of African studies in Russia. The Moscow-based Africa Studies Institute has a huge pack of research materials useful for designing an African agenda. In an interview, Professor Vladimir Shubin at the Institute for African Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences reiterated that Russia is not doing enough to communicate to the broad sectors of the public, particularly in Africa, true information about its domestic and foreign policies as well as the accomplishments of Russia鈥檚 economy, science and technology to form a positive perception of Russia within the context of the current global changes of the 21st century.

Under the geopolitical changes and circumstances, Russia would have to open up more especially working with strategically chosen social groups and business associations in Africa. China has such a strategy and resultantly has excellent footprints. While Deputy Minister Mikhail Bogdanov still talking about the 1950s-1960s, and about the past Soviet Union education, China鈥檚 current focus is on different forms of education, ranging from short-term, requalification courses and academic fellowships to the regular intake of African students.

With far-sightedness and long-term strategy, Beijing is very desirous to win the hearts and minds of Africa鈥檚 future leaders and influencers by offering them educational opportunities in China. It is investing and exercising soft power in the education sector, and it is reported that China provided 12,000 scholarships to African students in 2021, despite the fact that it was during the Covid-19 pandemic period.

Besides that, China has been training African civil servants and runs the Confucius institute in some 20 African countries. It has recently opened the first Party School and admitted the first batch of 120 participants from African ruling parties who are attending the workshop at the US$40 million facility in Tanzania funded by the Chinese Communist Party. There is now a total of 81,562 African students this 2022/23 academic year in China, according to the Chinese Ministry of Education.

The data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics shows that Asian countries have become the second most popular destination for African students studying abroad with China being number one followed by the likes of India, Japan, Korea, and Israel, among others. Judging from our monitoring and research, India has also taken steps aimed at building a more practical partnership in a number of spheres in the continent. New Delhi has a new set of opportunities in human resources development, information technology and education.

While Indian companies rely more on African talent, they do capacity building for the local population. The Indian diaspora plays its own bridging role between India and Africa. As the world focuses on Africa鈥檚 fast-growing economies, India offers many academic fellowships and internship opportunities for young Africans, it has the traditional annual training programmes in various universities and institutes in India.

The United States and European countries are investing in the youth. These European and Western countries, which Russians often criticized, train thousands yearly, ranging from short-term courses to long-term academic disciplines. During the days of Barak Obama, the White House created the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI). It brings 500 Africans to the White House in Washington and this YALI still runs various academic and training programmes for Africans. Before Covid-19, The Times Higher Education index indicated that approximately 43,000 Africans enrolled on American universities. There are many African universities and institutes with joint agreements running programs, including fellowships, together with Westerners and Europeans. That is compared to Russia鈥檚 annual scholarship of about 1,800.

The European Union (EU) has been focusing on the African youth. It embraces them with different kinds of training, fellowship programmes et cetera under its flagship policy on education. Many African countries have enormously benefited from educational initiatives during the past years. For instance, in August 2022, it offered postgraduate scholarships to over 200 young Nigerians in top European universities for the academic year. And if considering the whole of Africa, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The EU shows a consistent commitment to ramping up programmes and activities targeting vibrant young people from Africa.

France is a member of the European Union. France鈥檚 Ministry of Foreign Affairs together with the Ministry of Education is collaborating with French-speaking African countries to offer intensive orientation and educational training for 10,000 French teachers in Africa. The five-year training programme aims at strengthening France鈥檚 soft power.

Besides training French teachers, it has regular students intake from Africa. France, like any other foreign player, has been looking for effective ways of improving its public diplomacy, especially in French-speaking African countries.

From the Arab world and Gulf region, Turkey has been making inroads these years into Africa. It has shifted direction and now pursues a more diversified, multidimensional foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. Turkey was accorded observer status by the African Union. In a reciprocal move, the AU declared Turkey its strategic partner in 2008, and since then relations between Africa and Turkey are still gaining momentum. It trains more and more agricultural specialists for Africa.

In 2009, there were only 12 Turkish embassies in African countries, with five of them in North Africa. Now, there are 43. With tourism promotion at the hotspot, Turkish Airlines has flights to 60 different destinations in 39 countries on the continent while the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA) has nearly 30 coordination centres throughout Africa.

Arguably, the Presidential Special Representative for the Middle East and Africa, Mikhail Bogdanov, most probably understands all these when he admittedly said in his Interfax interview that other foreign players are active and operating in Africa. Statistics on African students are, in fact, still staggering. Russia鈥檚 Ministry of Science and Higher Education, citing confidentiality, declined to give the current figure for Africa.

For the coming years, Russia needs a model template of social policy for Africa. With the emerging new world order which invariably incorporates in its fold education and cultural influence 鈥?the importance of soft power 鈥?for making alliances and inroads, networking and collaborating with institutions, in Africa. In a transcript posted to the State Duma鈥檚 official website, during the inter-parliamentary conference, Chairman of the State Duma, Viacheslav Volodin, was convinced that cultural and educational cooperation could be equally important areas needed to be developed and intensified in Russia-African relations.

Professor Vladimir Filippov, former Rector of the Russian University of People鈥檚 Friendship (RUDN), popularly referred to as Patrice Lumumba Friendship University, has underscored the fact that social attitudes toward foreigners first have to change positively, the need to create a multicultural learning environment, then the need to expand educational and scientific ties between Russia and Africa.

Established in 1960 to provide higher education to Third World students, it later became an integral part of the Soviet cultural offensive in non-aligned countries. His university has gained international popularity as an educational institution located in southwest Moscow.

鈥淭he present and the future of Russia-Africa relations is not about charity, it鈥檚 about co-development,鈥?stated Evgeny Primakov, Head of the Russian Federal Agency for International Humanitarian Cooperation (Rossotrudnichestvo) and also a member of the Secretariat of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum.

The Secretariat of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum works under the Russian Foreign Ministry. It has, under its aegis, three coordination councils namely business, public and scientific councils. Primakov heads the humanitarian council that deals with education and humanitarian questions for the Foreign Ministry. While talking about initiatives especially in the sphere of education within the framework of the relationship between Russia and Africa, Primakov explicitly underlined the changing state of affairs in education and added that the number of Russian state scholarships for African citizens 鈥?for the whole continent made up of 54 African countries 鈥?has only increased from 1765 in 2019 to 1843 in 2020.

Primarily due to the coronavirus outbreak, Russian universities since then potential students have had difficulties with transportation, safety, and financing scholarships allocated through the budget. The Russian system of higher education needs to be adapted to the new realities so that it could gain more value on the international market, especially for Africa鈥檚 middle class whose kids could study on contracts in the Russian Federation. This is strictly not humanitarian aid as perceived by Mikhail Bogdanov and Evgeny Primakov.

Similarly at the Valdai Discussion Club, academic researchers from the Institute for African Studies and policy observers held discussions on current Russia鈥檚 policy, emerging opportunities and possibilities for partnerships in Africa. Quite interestingly, the majority of them acknowledged the need for Russia to be more prominent as it should be and work more consistently to achieve its strategic goals on the continent.

The Valdai Discussion Club was established in 2004 with the primary goal to promote dialogue between Russia and the rest of the world. It hosted an expert discussion themed 鈥淩ussia鈥檚 Return to Africa: Interests, Challenges, Prospects鈥?to brainstorm views on Africa. Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Africa Department were present and noted that there have been developments in relations with Africa.

Russia claims to have substantial influence in the education sphere. It consistently claims to have trained thousands and thousands of Africans from the 1950s and 1960s as emphatically explained by Deputy Minister Bogdanov. But why currently are the African youth and the middle class, African NGOs and civil society, so remote in Russia鈥檚 policy towards Africa? Cultural issues are catastrophic, indeed! There is nothing African, except African diplomatic offices in the Russian Federation. Who runs public outreach programmes that could change perceptions in Africa?

With the youth鈥檚 education, experts are still critical. Gordey Yastrebov, a Postdoctoral Researcher and Lecturer at the Institute for Sociology and Social Psychology at the University of Cologne (Germany), argues in an email interview discussion that 鈥渆ducation can be a tool for geopolitical influence in general, and for changing perceptions specifically, and Russia (just like any other country) could use it for that same purpose. However, Russia isn鈥檛 doing anything substantial on this front, at least there is no consistent effort with obvious outcomes that would make me think so. There are no large-scale investment programmes in education focusing on this.鈥?
He explains that Russian education can become appealing these days, but given that Russia can no longer boast any significant scientific and technological achievements. Western educational and scientific paradigm embraces cooperation and critical independent thinking, whereas this is not the case with the Russian paradigm, which is becoming more isolationist and authoritarian. Obviously, by now, Africa should look up to more successful examples elsewhere, perhaps in the United States and Europe.

In an interview with Professor Natalia Vlasova, Deputy Rector at the Department of International Relations and Cooperation of the Ural State University of Economics (USUE) in Yekaterinburg, explained that many African countries are developing rapidly, and the African elites and the growing middle-class are great potentials for sponsoring their children鈥檚 education abroad. She explained the necessity to develop bilateral ties not only in the economic sphere but also in education and culture and to promote the exchange of people and ideas in the social sphere.

鈥淲e must use the full potential interest and mutual sympathy between the peoples of Russia and Africa, a great desire of Russians and Africans to visit each other to make friends, establish new connections. It will be of high appreciation to African countries when Russian authorities create a social platform towards strengthening Russian-African relations,鈥?suggested Vlasova.

According to her, Russia could still offer credible alternative programmes bringing together Russians and Africans. She finally concluded: 鈥淚n times of Soviet Union, African countries were strategic partners, and now we should reactivate these relations because in the nearest future they will have big economic and political power. This could, indeed, be a huge market and has a potential basis for future diversified business.鈥?
Nevertheless, experts from the Moscow-based Center for Strategic Research acknowledged in an interview with this author that the percentage of Russian universities on the world market is considerably low. Due to this, there is a rare need to develop Russian education export opportunities, and take progressive measures to raise interest in Russian education among foreigners. This would raise the collaboration between Russia and Africa to a qualitatively new level and ultimately contribute to the economies and prosperity of both Africa and Russia.

As part of the renewed interest in Africa, Sergey Lavrov and Mikhail Bogdanov at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and top officials at the Ministry of Higher Education and related agencies have to work more on opportunities and diverse ways to increase the number of students, especially tuition paying agreements for children of the growing elite families and middle-class from African countries. It has to review its cultural component in its current foreign policy, undoubtedly, be directed at strengthening relations. It is certainly true that western and European systems classically appeal more to Africans. If Russia鈥檚 ultimate interest is to lead a fairer and more stable global system, then it is necessary to share these interests through the educational sphere in sub-Saharan Africa.

Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a widely circulated Russian daily newspaper, in the article also reported that Russia has to focus on the young population from developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It has to target the elite and middle class in these markets for the export of education which has great potential. The Gazeta concluded that Africa鈥檚 fast-growing population is a huge potential market for knowledge transfer and export education.

Beyond all these trends in the Russia-African relations discussed above, it is necessary here to recall that President Vladimir Putin particularly noted the good dynamics of specialist training and education in Russian educational institutions for African countries. Putin, however, suggested to Russian and African participants map out broad initiatives in the sphere of education and culture during the first summit in Sochi. For the joint work, there was a final joint declaration, adopted at the end of the summit. The document outlines a set of goals and objectives for further development of Russia-African cooperation.

"Interactions including diplomatic relations between states are old in human society and have evolved over time. Historically, this practice dates back to ancient times when kings and rulers sent emissaries and authorized representatives to other kingdoms to deliver messages and bring back information. The same history shows that during this time, powerful emperors received tributes through them. Interestingly, state relations became more defined, organized and consolidated with the signing of treaties, most notably, the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Popularly known as the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations (VCDR), This treaty significantly contributed to advancing rules guiding state relation. VCDR as a case in point, helped in codifying customary rules on relations between states. And today, its provisions have largely become part of general international law themselves and also guides state relations, covering a wide range of areas which include but is not restricted to political issues; economic matters; bilateral and multilateral agreements; public diplomacy; and consular diplomacy.

There is no gain saying that the above has been the blueprint from which states have interacted with each other over time in an attempt of realising their foreign policy objectives which is defined in terms of national interest, and this is not different from the interaction or relations between Nigeria and China.

For both nations, relations started in earnest in 1960, October to be precise, during the former鈥檚 independence from colonial rule, when the newly sovereign Nigerian government invited the government of the Peoples鈥?Republic of China (PRC) to witness the historic moment. However, official and diplomatic relations was established in February 1971. This year -1971, coincided with the year that Nigeria and other developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America supported, despite America鈥檚 protestation, opposition and rejection of Beijing鈥檚 21-year campaign to win world recognition as the one true government of China which was realized on the 25th of November 1971 when the PRC officially replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the United Nations and on the UN Security Council.

Undoubtedly since 1971 to date, relations between these two countries have grown to cover political/diplomatic, economic, cultural, social, and others areas, as there has been high level of visits from both sides which has built up both countries鈥?mutual political trust, exchanges and co-operations in the fields of economy, culture, science, education, health among others.

Having provided this background, I want to spend some time to take stock of just how far the relationship has come in the last fifty (50) years, with emphasis on the gains, and challenges as well.

From the political/diplomatic viewpoint, it is fitting to say that a lot of developments have been witnessed from both sides since the time diplomatic relation was formalized. For me, the event (i.e., the formalization of diplomatic relations) in itself was a watershed for inter-state visits from both sides. Why I said this is that from that time till date, virtually or almost all the Nigerian Heads of State and Presidents starting with General Yakubu Gowon to President Muhammadu Buhari have visited China. China on its part too has done likewise. Chinese leaders who have visited Nigeria are as follows: Vice Premier Geng Biao October 1978. Vice Premier Huang Hua November 1981. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun November 1984. Vice Premier Wu Xueqian March 1990. Vice Premier and foreign Minister Qian Qichen January 1995. State Councilor and Secretary General of the State Council Luo Gan September 1996. Premier Li Peng May1997. Special Envoy of the President Jiang Zeming, State Councilor Ismail Amat May 1999. Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan January 2000. President Jiang Zemin April 2002. Vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People鈥檚 Congress Han Qide December 2003. China鈥檚 Foreign Minister, Li Zhaoxing January 2006, and President Hu Jintao April 2006. Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi January 2010, Foreign Minister Wang Yi January 2017. Special Envoy of the President Xi Jinping, Yang Jiechi September 2019. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi January 2021. During the period of these visits, agreements were signed ranging from Agreement for Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, Protocol on Co-operation on Electric Power Projects in Nigeria to Protocol on Bilateral Co-operation in Steel Industry to Oil Industry Cooperation.

Furthermore, within this period, we have seen Nigeria support China鈥檚 principle of 鈥淥ne China, two systems鈥? In this case, Nigeria supported the return of Hong Kong and Macao to China in July 1997 and December 1999 respectively. Interestingly, in return, China reciprocated Nigeria鈥檚 kind gesture by launching Nigeria鈥檚 first space satellite to orbit called Nigcomsat 1R satellite, of which China Academy of Space Technology is the manufacturer. Other political engagements between the two states include the cooperation at the level of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) which was initiated at the Ministerial Conference in Beijing in 2000 with the aim of fostering solidarity and cooperation based on equality, consultation, consensus, friendship, partnership and mutual benefit. And the benefits from this engagement has flowed to other areas as we shall see later in this article.

On the economic front, a lot has also been witnessed on both sides. To be sure, since Nigeria established Economic relations with China in 1971, with her assent to the Joint Communiqu茅 on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, and both China and Nigeria being prominent members of G77-group of developing countries within the United Nations (which is aimed at promoting South鈥揝outh Trade and Cooperation), trading activities for example, has increased and spread to complex businesses between both states. And the reason for this increase in trading activities as captured by many experts on this subject matter including Utomi, is based on the fact that Nigeria has seen China as a better trading alternative because of the genuine interest of China in trading with Nigeria based on some of its comparative advantage products such as energy, raw materials and market expansion. It was in this regard that in 1994, the Sani Abacha regime (1993-1998) initiated a contact with Chinese government which led to the establishment of the Nigerian-Chinese Chambers of Commerce making way for China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) to win a $529 million contract to rehabilitate the Nigerian railway system in 1995.

An overview on trade relations shows that the extent of trade between Nigeria and China has tremendously grown. For instance, Nigeria鈥檚 total export to China in 2015 alone was US$307.3 million, with the main export commodity being oil and lubricants, which represented US$273.7 million. Thus, in terms of Nigeria鈥檚 exports to China, oil and lubricants ranked first, followed by beverages and live animals, while manufactured goods ranked fourth. Trade between the two states reached 15.3 billion dollars in 2018, thereby making it the main channel of boosting economic cooperation between the countries.

The area of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) has not been left out. The Chinese government on its part has invested heavily to the tune of $1.1 billion in Nigeria鈥檚 infrastructure, in the form of low-interest loans. These FDI outward flow has been on the increase over the years. In 2019 alone, about 123.27 million U.S. dollars鈥?worth of direct investments from China was made in Nigeria. One good thing about FDIs coming from China into Nigeria, as posited by prominent scholars 鈥?Izochukwu and Daniel, on Sino- Nigeria relations is that these investments have been carried out largely by state-owned enterprises or Joint venture which offer relatively large aid component in form of concessionary interest rates and grant element unlike loans from the multilateral finance organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Today there are over 218 Chinese companies in Nigeria doing one business or the other. The major ones among them include, SINOPEC, which is into oil and gas with staff strength of about 373, 375 staff; CNPC- an oil and gas company whose staff is 1.6 million; SEPCO- they are into Electric and Power construction and have work force of 9,756 people. Others include, CCECC 鈥?a 70, 000 staff strength construction company which constructed the Games Village Lekki Free Trade zone; SCEC 鈥?a construction and real estate with a staff strength of 121, 500; CNOON Offshore oil and gas who have total number of 21,000 as staff; Huawei and ZTE with staff strengths of 51,000 and, 85,232 respectively.

Furthermore, this period also saw China provide the finance, and as well construct the, Abuja-Kaduna Railway, Abuja Metro Light Rail, Abuja and Port Harcourt Airport terminals Lekki Free Trade Zones, Ogun 鈥?Guangdong Free Trade Zone, the Zungeru Hydro Power Dam and the University of Transportation in Daura, Katsina state.

Nigeria has also cooperated with China within this period in the area of culture, education and in the military field. Agreed that China and Nigeria have different historical experiences and cultural traditions, yet both nations have cooperated culturally in a globalized environment. In this regard, we have seen Beijing making remarkable effort in promoting Chinese culture in Nigeria by establishing two Confucius institutes in Nigerian Universities which is helping in the teaching and spread of Chinese language within the country. They are the Chinese Confucius institute at the University of Lagos (Unilag) and the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (NAU). The centers have not only helped in language learning and culture but also in vocational training which presents Nigeria the opportunity to tap into the second largest economy and train its teeming youths to acquire the necessary skills needed in this 21st century.

On education, China and Nigeria have signed an agreement on cultural cooperation and a protocol on cooperation between institutions of higher learning of the two countries and that is why 512 out of the 6,845 Nigerian students who are studying in China as at 2019, are on Chinese government scholarship. On the other hand, far back in 2011, 10 Chinese students had enrolled into the Bayero University, Kano to study the Hausa language. I am very sure the number has increased by now. Military wise, in the wake of the Boko Haram insurgency, both sides saw the need to put necessary machinery in place to address the security challenge. Towards the realization of this objective, China helped to train Nigerian military.

As I conclude, it is interesting to note the relationship the two states within the period under review have not been without challenges which ranged from trade imbalance (on the part of Nigeria) to unexpected changes of international situations, yet the bond between the two have remained ever new in the face of these challenges. Findings revealed that reasons for this enduring relation are not farfetched. One of the reasons is tied to the perception they both have about each other as being good brothers in political contacts which always make them treat each other sincerely, friendly and as equal partners.

Another reason is that they both see themselves as good friends at the international stage that need to work toward south-south cooperation and for a just, fair and reasonable new international political and economic order. The last but not the least is that they both see themselves as nations saddled with the responsibility of carrying the burden of safeguarding the common interests of developing countries.

I strongly believe that with more hard work, sincerity and collaboration on the part of both countries, Nigeria and China can, and will achieve more goals that will enhance their foreign policies in the nearest future.

"The first female Dean of the Faculty of Law, University of Lagos, Prof. Chioma Kanu Agomo, will on March 1, 2021 bow out of the University as she clocks 70 years.

Already, several events have been lined up to herald her celebrated exit from the ivory tower, after over 40 years of unblemished service as a foremost law teacher and expert.

Aside from a Special Board of Studies session and Exaugural Lecture being organised by the Faculty of Law, a Thanksgiving Service will hold on March 1, 2021 at 10 am at the Chapel of Christ Our Light, University of Lagos, Akoka. The Thanksgiving Service will also be streamed live at bit.ly/agomothanksgiving. Also, an autobiography titled 鈥淢y Story, My Song鈥?will be unveiled the same day at 1pm at the Church鈥檚 Global Christian Centre (GCC) Auditorium.

While the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe is the Chief Host for both events, the Secretary to Abia State Government, Chris Ezem (also a Lawyer) is the Guest of Honour. The book presentation will be chaired by Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu, while renowned law teacher and jurist, Prof. Taiwo Osipitan, SAN is the book presenter. The book reviewer is Prof. Chimdi Maduagwu, Director of the Confucius institute at UNILAG. Attendance at both events is however strictly restricted, due to COVID-19 regulations.

Prof. Agomo was born on March 1, 1951 to Sir Henry Kanu Offonry OFR and Madam Chijiago Stella Udeogu of Nkpa in Bende Local Government of Abia State. Chioma鈥檚 parents separated in 1954, when she was three years old. She was thereafter, raised by her paternal grandmother, Madam Nnenne Ogbodiya.

After her early education, she was admitted by Queen Mary College, University of London to read Law in 1973. She graduated in 1976 with an Upper Honours Bachelor鈥檚 degree and earned her Master of Laws (LLM) degree (with Merit) in 1977.

She returned to Nigeria in September 1979 and enrolled at the Nigerian Law School. She was admitted to the Nigerian Bar in 1980. From September 1980, she undertook her National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) primary assignment in the Department of Commercial and Industrial Law, University of Lagos. She was retained immediately after her service year in 1981, and thus began her UNILAG career that has spanned almost 41 years. Agomo rose through the ranks to become a Professor of Law of the University of Lagos in 2001, notionally backdated to 1999.

She is a member of the Board of Trustees of various organisations including the Nigerian Association of Law Teachers (NALT) and Prison Fellowship Nigeria (PFN); Council and Life Member of the Nigerian Society of International Law; Member, Nigerian Bar Association; former Chairperson, Chapel Committee, Chapel of Christ Our Light, University of Lagos, and currently its honorary Legal Adviser. Professor Agomo is an Honorary Fellow of her alma mater, Queen Mary College, University of London, and a Fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Chartered Arbitrators.

Prof. Agomo is married to Dr. Philip Agomo. She is a proud mother of two biological sons and two grand-daughters, and is also blessed with many non-biological children and grand-children, who have all enriched her life."
"However, the issue here is whether the congresses organised to elect the executives of the party at all levels are legal, despite being chaired by a serving Governor of a State. This action constitutes the internal affairs of the Party and has nothing to do with the governing of the party. This is buttressed by the fact that even when there is an existing legitimately elected members of the National Working Committee of a party, the NWC can legally appoint a committee to over- see the election of the new executive members into the Party in a convention. For the purposes of emphasis, when we organised the convention that brought Oshiomhole to power as National Chairman of APC, in which I had the privilege of serving in the Venue and Protocol Commit- tee, the Chairman of the Convention Committee was the serving Governor of Jigawa State, His Excellency Badaru, while John Oyegun was the National Chairman of the Party. This was purely legal and the resultant elected executive members purely legitimate. Even the opposition PDP, that was shouting everywhere that every act of the CECPC is null and void because it is headed by a serving Governor, recently established two committees, headed by two serving Governors of their Party, after sacking their National Chairman, through the back door. One committee is a convention planning committee headed by Gov Fintiri of Adamawa, and the other is a zoning committee headed by Gov Ugwuanyi of Enugu State. Does it mean that every action taken by these Governors is null and void? No, because their actions do not amount to the governing of their Party. They are simply helping their Party to perform specific functions which is their internal affairs not subject to questioning by external parties. It follows, therefore, that if the CECPC had restricted itself strictly to organising the convention within six months and handed over, there wouldn鈥檛 be any problem.

The apprehension for the legality of APC Congresses stemmed from the Supreme Court Judgement on the Ondo State governorship election in which the Petitioners filed their petition on the ground that Akeredolu and Deputy were at the time of the election not qualified to contest the Ondo State Governorship election held on 10th October, 2020 because their sponsorship by APC as its candidates for the said election was invalid because the letter of 27th of July, 2020, written by APC, submitting the names of Akeredolu and Deputy to INEC, as its candidates for the election, was signed by Gov Mai Mala Buni, who signed as its acting National Chairman, when he is also the Governor of Yobe State, in contradiction to Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17(iv) of the APC Constitution. There鈥檚 no doubt that the two offices were executive offices which Gov Buni was unqualified to occupy at the same time and the Supreme Court Judges held as such. In the words of the majority Judges, 鈥渢he contention that Governor Mai Mala Buni as Governor of Yobe State has violated S.183 of the Constitution by holding the office of acting National Chairman of the 2nd respondent is a very serious one with grave consequences for him and no doubt for the 2nd respondent (APC) as well鈥? Justice Mary Odili of the minority Judgement was of the opinion that when APC put up a person not qualified to author its nomination by virtue of the provision of Article 17(iv) of its Constitution and Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution to do so, that document has no validity, and thereby void. However, this grave consequence does not deny the Governor, as a member of APC, from rendering his services to his party, in his capacity as a member, not as the Acting National Chairman of the Party. Any act that is done by the Governor to perform specific function for the party in an Ad-hoc Committee tailored towards achieving aims for the party to strengthen its internal affairs is purely legal and cannot be questioned by non APC members. Heading an elective committee to organise congresses for his party is not illegal and portends no grave danger to him and to the party. However, the committee must continue on that trajectory and complete the entire congresses which terminates with the National Convention in which the national executives will emerge. Therefore, an elective committee, is a committee saddled with the responsibility of electing party officials who will govern the Party not to govern the Party themselves. Moreover, even if one per- son is sitting in a body illegally, it does not have the power to nullify all the acts of the body. The personal acts of the official may be null and void but not that of the entire body. A typical example is that of the National Assembly, where the vote of any unqualified member cannot render the whole resolution void. In this regard, APC Congresses being held are legal."

The Confucius institute at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, has again won the first position in the National Championship Global Competition organized by the Centre for Language Education and Cooperation (formerly, HANBAN) for students of Nigerian universities.

The Institute established 13 years ago during the tenure of Prof. Ilochi Okafor as Vice Chancellor has represented Nigeria many times in the Chinese Bridge Competition for university students.

Director of the Institute, Prof. Chukwudi Yu Zhangbao in a statement issued in Awka said with the latest development, the Institute was poised to consolidate its strong presence in the world.

He disclosed that Miss Michael-Praise Chinecherem (a third-year student of the Chinese Studies Department), has entered the second stage of the month-long competition being held online, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

鈥淐hinecherem is now among the world鈥檚 top 30, occupying the second position among the six African representatives remaining in the competition. Her co-competitors (there are a total of 125 participants) are from different parts of the world -Asia, the Americas, Europe, Oceania and other parts of Africa,鈥?he said."
"From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha

Encomiums have continued pouring for the Confucius institute at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, for maintaining its lead as the best Chinese language and culture training school in Nigeria.

This time, Ms Michael -Praise Chinecherem, a third-year student of the Chinese Studies department, won the third position as well as the outstanding online personality award in the 2021 Chinese Bridge competition organised by the Centre for Language Education and Cooperation (formerly Hanban).

The nine -month global competition, Daily Sun learnt, involved 125 national champions coming from 101 countries with a total of 70,000 students participating in the national preliminaries of the competition.

Speaking on the development, Dr Anas Elochukwu of the Confucius institute, Awka said Michael, the first student from that department to participate in the annual competition, represented Nigeria, having won the national championship organised by the Chinese Embassy for students of Nigerian universities in July 2021.

Elochukwu said that Michael was so good and scintillating during the contest that the Chinese referees of the competition tipped her to emerge African champion until her abrupt exit, which was caused by abysmal internet connection.

鈥淭he abysmal connection prevented her from progressing to compete for the African (continental) champion,鈥?he sadly noted.

He disclosed that owing to her outstanding performance in the competition, she has been inundated with job offers by numerous Chinese firms based in Nigeria.

Prof. Charles Esimone , Vice Chancellor of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, who was elated at the feat, commended the Confucius institute headed by Chief Prof. Yu Chukwudi Zhangbao (Ezi Oyi I of Unizik) for its role in producing the first generation of Chinese-speaking Nigerians.

On his own part, Chief Yu, who arrived in Nigeria three years ago, ascribed the achievements by the Institute during the past two-and-half years to the unwavering support of the vice chancellor.

Michael, in a brief chat, appreciated her teachers at the Institute and the university management for their encouragements so far. She said she intends to go to China next year for her post graduate studies."

The Charge d鈥橝ffaires of the Embassy of the People鈥檚 Republic of China in Nigeria, Mr Zhao Yong, has disclosed that the all-round, wide-ranging and highly-quality bilateral cooperation between China and Nigeria has been a pacesetter for China-Africa cooperation.

Zhao spoke during a roundtable dialogue on the 鈥楩orum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) at 20 years: Achievements and Prospects鈥?organised by the Centre for China Studies (CCS) in Abuja.

Zhao said the past 20 years have been a journey of productive cooperation between China and Africa, disclosing that in 2019, direct Chinese investment stock in Africa topped US$49.1 billion, up by nearly 100 times from the year 2000.

Zhao also said China-Africa trade reached US$208.7 billion, 20 times the size of 2000 and China has been Africa鈥檚 largest trading partner for 11 years in a row, and has contributed more than 20 percent to Africa鈥檚 growth for a number of years.

He further said cooperation in other fields, from technology, education, culture, health, to people-to-people exchange, peace and security, is also making significant headway.

Zhao added that in year 2020 in particular, by fighting the COVID-19 pandemic together with solidarity and cooperation, China and Africa have shown rock-steady brotherhood and magnificent unity.

He explained that China delivered over 400 tons of critically needed medical supplies to 53 African countries and the African Union, even as he said China dispatched public health experts to 15 African countries.

A total number of 46 hospitals from 42 African countries, Zhao stated, affirmed to attend the cooperation mechanism to pair up with Chinese hospitals.

鈥淚 have been in Nigeria for two years. I am fortunate to be an eyewitness of so many great things happening in this great nation in spite of the challenges it faces. And I feel proud that China has been proved to be a strategic partner of Nigeria in its pursuit of peace and prosperity.

鈥淎s the largest developing country in the world, China highly values its relations with Nigeria, the largest developing country in Africa. Over the past two decades, the all-round, wide-ranging and highly-quality bilateral cooperation between China and Nigeria has been a pacesetter for China-Africa cooperation,鈥?Zhao said.

Zhao further said the political foundation between China and Nigeria has been cemented, saying that under the strategic guidance and personal commitment of President Xi Jinping and President Muhammadu Buhari, the political trust between China and Nigeria has been significantly deepened.

He recalled that in 2018, President Buhari was the very first head of state President Xi met with bilaterally after the Beijing Summit.

Zhao also said in 2019, President Xi鈥檚 special envoy, Yang Jiechi, paid a visit to Nigeria and held fruitful discussions with President Buhari.

The Chinese envoy further said in June, 2020, President Buhari attended the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity against COVID-19 and commended China鈥檚 support to Nigeria.

He stated that practical cooperation has been fruitful within the framework of

FOCAC, while also saying that Nigeria remained China鈥檚 largest project-contracting

market, largest export market, second largest trading partner,

and major investment destination in Africa.

鈥淚n 2019, the bilateral trade volume was $19.27 billion with an annual increase of 26.3 percent which came first among China鈥檚 top 40 trading partners. Many flagship projects 鈥?the Abuja-Kaduna Railway, the Abuja Light Rail, the airport terminals in Abuja and Port Harcourt, the Ogun Guandong and Lekki Free Trade Zones, the University of Transportation in Daura to name a few 鈥?have been completed and put into use.

鈥淧eople-to-people exchanges have been thriving. In 2019, the number of Nigerian students study in China rose to 6800, which stands first in all African countries. Many of them have been

covered by a wide variety of scholarships. More and more Nigerian students choose to study Chinese in their universities and many universities are about to establish Confucius institute in the near future.

鈥淢utual support on anti-pandemic has been further strengthened. The people of China and Nigeria have been helping and supporting each other, and pulling together in times of

difficulties. President Buhari commended China鈥檚 efforts in fighting against COVID-19 in his statement of solidarity as early as February 2. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria,

China stood firmly with our Nigerian friends through providing governmental medical supplies, and sharing experience on treating COVID-19,鈥?Zhao also said.

Also speaking, the Acting Head of the Asia and Pacific Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Aisha Dewa, said FOCAC, in its two decades of existence, has driven rapid development of China-Africa鈥檚 relations.

Dewa added that FOCAC boasts of over US $170 billion of annual trade volume, while also saying that China鈥檚 investment in Africa rose to $40 billion over the years.

Dewa who was represented by Stephen Anthony Awuru, an officer in the division, stated that Nigeria has benefited from FOCAC鈥檚 $60 billion funding for critical infrastructure, China鈥檚 support for scholarships, military trainings, security assistance, agricultural and concessionary loans to fund infrastructure projects.

Dewa also listed other benefits from China to include support for humanitarian and military assistance to Nigeria in the fight against terrorism to the tune of RMB 50 million.

鈥淣igeria appreciates the Government and People of China for their investment in the Nigerian economy. Also worthy of commendation is the quality of work and timely delivery of the projects executed by the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC),鈥?Dewa said."

"鈥agos declares two wanted over contact with index case

鈥igerian scientists record breakthrough in virus sequencing

Omololu Ogunmade, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Martins Ifijeh in Lagos, Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka

The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, yesterday confirmed a second case of coronavirus disease, officially known as COVID-19, in Nigeria.

He also said the Nigerian who tested positive to the disease in Washington DC was in Nigeria February, but that it was unlikely he got infected in the country.

In a statement made available to THISDAY yesterday, Ehanire said the patient who tested positive yesterday to the virus, was an Ogun State contact of the index case, an Italian, and that he has no significant symptom.

He said: 鈥淭his brings the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria to two. The newly confirmed case in Nigeria is not a new importation, but a contact of the index case, who has since been in isolation and is under clinical follow-up. The new case presently does not have any clinical symptoms but he is comfortable and in care at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Lagos.

鈥淲e have diligently and conscientiously pursued contact tracing and monitoring of people who met with the index Italian patient,鈥?he said.

The minister had last week said 40 persons in Ogun and 20 in Lagos, who had contact with the index Italian patient, were under isolation.

He explained that those monitored have remained free of any symptoms since but that as it is with the ministry鈥檚 practice, it decided to test them for the possible presence of coronavirus, adding that one unfortunately tested positive yesterday.

Ehanire said: 鈥淪ince the beginning of the outbreak in China and subsequent spread to other countries, one of the important response strategies at the containment stage has been to identify all contacts, ensure their strict isolation and to follow up daily with checks for any symptoms of the disease.

鈥淔ollowing recent experience from other countries and evidence from newly published studies on non-symptomatic infections, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), advised that samples should be taken from all contacts of the index case for testing. It is in this process that this new case was detected.

鈥淩ecent studies in China have shown that increased surveillance, self-isolation and in particular, contact tracing does reduce the risk of spread because of further opportunities for transmission of the virus by the infected patient in the community, are limited.鈥?
According to him, all other contacts of the index case in Ogun and Lagos will remain in isolation and testing will be carried out on those not yet tested, including some in other states.

Ehanire also stated that the federal government was in contact with US Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and the one in Abuja and through that got to know that the Nigerian infected with coronavirus in Washington was in Lagos last month.

鈥淗owever, given the timelines between the time he was in Nigeria briefly and when he became ill, the likelihood that he was infected in Lagos is very low.

鈥淲e are assuring Nigerians of our commitment to do all that is needed to control the spread of this outbreak. Since the first case was confirmed in Nigeria on February 27, 2020, the National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) in Abuja continues to work closely with Lagos and Ogun State EOCs to coordinate response activities,鈥?he stated.

He advised against spreading misinformation to cause fear and panic.

The minister also highlighted a major breakthrough by Nigeria, saying that a team of researchers from various institutions in the country have successfully performed the genome sequencing of coronavirus.

According to him, the team, including scientists from the Centre for Human and Zoology Virology in LUTH, African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases in Redeemers University and the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) Lagos, combined their efforts to successfully perform the genome sequencing of the coronavirus strain that the index case brought to Nigeria.

He said the team proved the virus to be a match with the virus circulating in Italy and Wuhan, a Chinese town where the outbreak first occurred.

鈥淭his was coordinated by the Lagos State Ministry of Health and NCDC. It is the first time the sequencing of this virus has been performed in Africa,鈥?he added.

Ehanire said the medical feat had been shared with international authorities, adding that the Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has sent a congratulatory message to the Nigerian scientists for the achievement.

The minister had earlier in Benin, Edo State capital, yesterday said the federal government had spent about N1 billion since the disease broke out.

According to him, the second confirmed case was detected early due to close monitoring of contacts, adding that the N1 billion spent so far was committed to monitoring and preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The minister explained that the federal government has also got promises of cash donations from private individuals and organisations.

鈥淭he government of Nigeria has committed about N1 billion to fight the virus.鈥?
He said every amount that was requested by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had been granted by the president with no delay at all. Money is available and is being used and utilised.

鈥淲e also have promises of donations from several organisations, private sectors and we got a letter the other day that we can apply for the global funds that have been allocated to Nigeria for this response,鈥?he said.

Buhari Sets up Task Force for Control of COVID-19

Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday in Abuja set up a Presidential Task Force for the Control of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).

In a statement, presidential spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, said the president constituted the committee in view of COVID-19鈥檚 potential to cause significant disruption in the country鈥檚 health services and negatively affect the economy.

Shehu said Buhari also constituted the committee ahead of a probable major outbreak of the disease in view of the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO).

He said the committee is expected to conclude its assignment within six months.

鈥淭his action is in preparation for the unlikely but probable major outbreak of the disease in the country, which will require a multi-sectoral inter-governmental approach as advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) similar to that adopted for the HIV epidemic in the last two decades,鈥?he said.

The committee, chaired by Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, also has Dr. Sani Aliyu as National Coordinator.

Other members of the committee are the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire; Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola; Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika; Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Services, Ms. Sadiya Farouk, and Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu.

Others are the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Minister of Environment, Alhaji Mohammed Mamood; Director-General, State Services, Alhaji Yusuf Bichi; Director-General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Dr. Chike Ihekweazu, and WHO Country Representative.

UNIZIK Suspends Chinese Language Programme

Meanwhile, the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka in Anambra State has suspended the Confucius institute programme, which teaches the Chinese language and other country-to-country relations of the Asian giant in view of the outbreak of coronavirus.

The Vice-Chancellor, Prof Charles Esimone, told journalists during a press conference to unveil its programme for the forthcoming 14th convocation of the institution that the programmes would now be done online.

鈥淟ast December, most of our Chinese lecturers in that institute went on holiday but when the disease broke early this year, we had to suspend the programme and stop them from coming back immediately,鈥?he said.

Esimone said because of the importance of the programme, the university was considering starting the programme online, to fill the void.

Lagos Declares Two Wanted over Contact with Index Case

Meanwhile, the Lagos State Government has declared two persons, who had contact with the index case wanted.

They were identified by the Ministry of Health as Enwelunta Obumnore Godfrey and Salami Abiodun Sadeeq.

The state Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, told reporters yesterday that Godfrey and Sadeeq who had been in contact with the secondary case of Coronavirus will begin a 14-day isolation process.

The secondary case of Coronavirus was the individual, who had direct contact with the index case, a 44-year-old Italian male, who is currently quarantined at the Mainland Hospital, an infectious disease facility in Lagos.

Abayomi said: 鈥淭he secondary COVID-19 patient has had contact with a few people and those contacts will begin a 14-day isolation process.

鈥淎s per our protocol, we have the capacity to test so that we can pick up whether any of those in isolation are turning positive and we have tested the 40 individuals in isolation in Ewekoro at the Lafarge factory because that was the group that had close contact with the index case.

鈥淥ut of the 40, we detected one positive and that individual happened to have spent a lot of time with the index case by virtue of his job.

鈥淭hat demonstrates the first transmission for the index case and the good news is that we have the individual under surveillance, so that significantly minimises the chance of transmission to a large number of people.鈥?
The commissioner also said the government was still in search of the remaining two passengers aboard the Turkish Airlines with the Italian coronavirus patient.

He appealed to the two individuals to reach out to the ministry.

鈥淚t is vitally important that you reach out to us with the numbers that are generally available with the press -08023169485 or 08033565529 or 08052817243 or to the Federal Ministry of Health or to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control,鈥?the commissioner said."
"PROF. DURO ONI

His pleasant persona places him on a plane unrivalled. Understated in looks, he possesses the charm that eludes a galaxy of star actors and actresses. In the sometimes surreal, effervescent world of drama and arts, his illustrious credentials shimmer and tower above many others. But his effusion is found in humility and simplicity. Were he a rock star, he鈥檇 be one of the world鈥檚 finest. Had he ventured into Hollywood, Idris Elba would grow green with envy watch him act. Prof. Duro Oni may not command a cult following, have a celebrity halo or named among the pantheon of legends, he remains an enduring figure in Nigeria鈥檚 scholarly firmament. Funke Olaode sums up the stages and scenes of this compelling character at the Department of

Creative Arts, University of Lagos.

Prof. Duro Oni. No glitz. No glamour. Instead, when you meet the professor, you鈥檙e filled with awe by his grace, gumption, genuineness, and genius. He鈥檚 a true-blue academic, intellectually-driven, scholarly-inspired and understatedly phenomenal. Even these adjectives have only scratched the surface of Prof. Oni. At 68, with enchanting childhood nurtured in the ben of Minna, Oni has a penchant for the arts. The eclectic man of letters is imbued with the capacity to make the complex, simple. He finds great strength in the seeming weakness of simplicity and humility. It was deliberate.

The Osun State native knows much about this and he鈥檚 willing, in unassuming fashion, to tell more about his life, ideals, and milestones. As an introduction, he informs whoever cares to listen: 鈥淚 consider myself a man of simplicity. I relate well to people of different backgrounds and status. I feel at home with the high and mighty, with colleagues and also with my younger and junior staff. I consider people who have airs around them as suffering from some complex proving that they are superior to the other person. No matter what office I hold, I operate an open-door policy,鈥?says Prof. Oni.

Oni鈥檚 parents hailed from Osun State but the scholar was born in Minna in the present-day Niger State. He has fond memories of his parents, even his grandparents. Wushishi offered him a canvas of colourful episodes to reflect on and his parents and grandparents were as actors on a stage whose performance later impacted on his life鈥檚 ideals and path.

Recalling his childhood, he said, 鈥淢y father worked for the Nigerian Railways Corporation in Wushishi before he established his own business in Minna and got into produce buying. My mother also ran a small restaurant at the railway station in Minna and was also an active member of the Young Women鈥檚 Christian Association of the Anglican Church and served as the secretary for some 20 years.鈥?
He adds, 鈥淢y parents met in Minna and got married there. My mother鈥檚 parents also lived in Minna and ran their own businesses (there too).

鈥淢y parents were very enterprising and I believe I may have inherited some of that from them. In terms of discipline, my father鈥檚 favourite words were: 鈥楻emember the son of who you are.鈥?It carried a lot of weight and meaning and indirectly telling you that you had to stay on the path of righteousness.鈥?
Prof. Oni pauses momentarily after reminiscing about his parents. At this point, it鈥檚 not hard to imagine the twinkle, in his focused eyes, that lights up his studied face.

鈥淚t was a very pleasant childhood,鈥?he discloses with delight when asked about his growing up.

Then, Prof. Oni shares some bits of his life鈥檚 history. As he tells his magnificent story, it鈥檚 moderated by heavy understatement. The professor, despite the good life he has enjoyed as a kid and the level he has attained in life as an adult, has remained modest, humble and simple.

鈥淲e lived in our own house,鈥?Oni says. But admits: 鈥淢y father was quite wealthy and he drove us to school.

鈥淚 also had a bicycle that I could ride to school. My maternal grandfather was also said to have been the first person to own a car in Minna! My parents and grandparents all owned houses in Minna. Because of the nature of our school and the close-knit community in Minna, we spoke English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo in school and at home.鈥?
As he speaks on, you鈥檒l notice how life and his parents had prepared him for a happy future and great achievements.

鈥淚n Kaduna, my school was close to the Nigerian Defence Academy,鈥?Prof. Oni recalls. 鈥淪o many of my classmates and schoolmates went to the academy and became top-ranking military officers. All (of them) are retired now though. Because of my upbringing in the North, most of my very close friends are from the North. You can find them in the judiciary, civil service, military, and academics.鈥?
Born December 15, 1952, Prof. Oni鈥檚 academic journey began at St. Peter鈥檚 Primary School in Minna from 1959 to 1965. Afterward, he attended St. Peter鈥檚 College, Kaduna from 1966 to 1970. In 1971, he was admitted into the University of Ibadan and went to California Institute of the Arts for his master鈥檚, graduating in 1983. He came back to his alma mater to have his PhD.

Today, he is one of the most sought-after professors of creative arts in Nigeria and abroad.

With a countenance characterized by a smile, his lips rise, spread, lower with reminiscences. As he narrates the episode of his life that he believes was life-defining, prof. Oni says: 鈥淚 did a lot of school dramas, radio and television dramas at the then RTK (Radio/Television Kaduna) with producers that included Dan Awodoye, Ambrose Anejo and Adamu Augie.

鈥淲e had weekly appearances on radio and television and we were paid three pounds per episode, which was a lot of money then. I also participated in the British Council Drama workshops in Kaduna. The workshops were for professionals but my involvement was considered sufficiently high to have been invited. I never wanted to be anything else, but a dramatist.鈥?
That he never wanted to be anything else but a dramatist was strange at the time. In fact, his desire and dream to be a dramatist earned him scorn rather than a pat on the back. it was a golden era when most people took pride in medicine, engineering, and law. But be a dramatist?

Only Prof. Oni can explain what happened next.

鈥淚 did not have any problems convincing my parents,鈥?he says with nostalgic delight. What else could stand in his way? There appeared to be nothing.

鈥淏ut,鈥?explains Oni, 鈥渁 lecturer/uncle, who was of the opinion that drama as a career would mean my working for Baba Sala (Moses Olaiya)鈥檚 comedy group.鈥?That was a dampener. But trust the young Oni.

Continuing, the professor says, 鈥淚 took a little time to explain to my mother (now deceased) the career opportunities open to me and she supported me. She was of the view that I was sufficiently bright to study any course, and if I chose drama, then it was fine with her.鈥?
A little digression: Oni may want to hide. The truth, however, is as a youngster he was very brilliant and studying hard was second nature to

He acknowledges: 鈥淢y nickname as a child was 鈥極ri ni iwe wa鈥? intelligence is inborn. With modesty, I was not hassled to study as I always excelled in school.鈥?
To cut the long story short, at the age of 24, Prof. Oni joined the then Centre for Cultural Studies of the University of Lagos, which was a research and performing arts outfit. With his intellectual and academic prowess on display, he earned a federal government scholarship to the California Institute of the Arts.

Over the last 46 years, Prof. Oni has continued to display brilliance as a distinguished scholar and an outstanding administrator. He was appointed the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Management Services) from February 4, 2013, to February 3, 2017; the Dean, Faculty of Arts from 2009 to 2013; professor and head of the Department of Creative Arts from 2006 to 2009. That鈥檚 not all. Oni is a fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in the UK. He served on the University of Lagos鈥?governing council for eight years.

He was also the pioneer director of the Confucius institute, from 2008 to 2009; the director of the Centre for Cultural Studies from 1992 to 1997. In a career spanning more than 40 years at the University of Lagos, Prof. Oni initiated and developed two programmes (Creative Arts, Theatre Arts, Music and Visual Arts) at the Bachelor鈥檚, Master鈥檚, M.Phil. and PhD levels and a Bachelor鈥檚 degree in Chinese Studies.

He was also the director general/CEO of the Centre for Black and African Arts and Civilization (CBAAC) between 2000 and 2006; the special assistant/adviser to the Minister of Culture and Social Welfare/Youth and Sports from 1990 to1992. An academic of repute, Oni has at least books and over 60 articles published in reputable journals and chapters in books in the areas of Theatre Arts Design and Aesthetics, Dramatic Literature and Criticism, Management, Cultural Studies and the Nollywood/Nigerian films.

The professor is also a fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters, the Society of Nigerian Theatre Artistes (SONTA), an advisory board member of the National Association of Nigerian Theatre Arts Practitioners (NANTAP), and a senior overseas fellow of the Ferguson Centre, Open University in the United Kingdom.

Looking back on all this, Prof. Oni says: 鈥淢y first appointment at the University of Lagos in 1992 was at the then Centre for Cultural Studies of the university which was established in 1975 when Prof. J. F. Ade Ajayi was the vice-chancellor. I felt that it was time for the centre to move from being a research and performing arts centre to a degree-awarding one.

鈥淚, therefore, initiated and chaired a committee to fashion out a degree programme in Creative Arts with the three arms of Theatre Arts, Visual Arts and Music. The department was approved eventually and took off in 1998. Four years after the establishment, I also chaired the committee for the programme to be extended to postgraduate studies for the Master鈥檚, M.Phil and PhD. Since then, we have graduated thousands of first degree, hundreds of Master鈥檚 and some 40 PhDs. I supervised seven of the PhDs and currently have five candidates on the programme.鈥?
Speaking further, Oni notes, 鈥淎s for the B.A. Chinese Studies Degree Programme, I was appointed the pioneer director of the Confucius institute at the University of Lagos in 2007. As the director of the institute, which was devoted to Chinese language and culture, I felt that being located in the university that we needed to expand the scope. So, as the dean of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Lagos, I constituted a committee that comprised scholars in language and literature and we got Soochow University in China to partner us on the 1+2+1 B.A. Chinese degree programme. The students spend the first year at the University of Lagos, the second and third year in China and the fourth and final year back at the University of Lagos. We have recently reviewed the programme to 2+1+1 (two years in Unilag, one year in China and a final year back in Unilag). We graduated six sets of the B.A. Chinese Studies degree programme under the old scheme and would commence the new one once the coronavirus pandemic is halted.鈥?
Since 1976 he鈥檚 been working at Unilag.

鈥淚 joined the institution just before I turned 24 and by the grace of God, I鈥檒l turn 68 in December this year. It has been great being here all this time. I have made my modest contributions to the university and perhaps more important, the university has been good to me. It has assisted in advancing my career and my development,鈥?he says with a sense of satisfactory sobriety.

Seeking greener pastures is often an irresistible allure. Prof. Oni, however, focuses more on his calling than the pastures lusher and greener on the other side.

In his characteristic simplicity, the prof says, 鈥淟ife in academics is a calling. Financial rewards are by the way. When you see your students do well, it is the most satisfying reward. Some of my former students are now my colleagues in Unilag and other universities in Nigeria and abroad.鈥?
He discloses that his staying power is being relevant. 鈥淥ne has not been on the same spot in over four decades. There has not been a dull moment in my life and career.鈥?
Professor thinks Nollywood has the potential as the next cash cow to boost Nigeria鈥檚 GDP.

鈥淵es. The arts and entertainment are interwoven. This is the reason we established the Department of Creative Arts with the three arms of theatre arts (which incorporates film studies and entertainment technology), visual arts (which encompasses painting, graphics, textiles, sculpture, ceramics, etc) and music (which ranges from voice, piano, choral, instrumental, classical and contemporary, etc). All our programmes are backed with solid theoretical grounding and exposure to the practice.

鈥淥ur students create jobs on graduation. Nigeria鈥檚 GDP was revised upward with the incorporation of the creative economy. We have a comparative advantage in the areas which we can continue to build on. I have been involved with some research work with the King鈥檚 College, the University of London since 2016 and it is focused on the African Creative Economy. Before then, we worked on Nollywood and the African Diaspora with the Ferguson Centre (2006-2015),鈥?Oni points out.

However, he doesn鈥檛 believe Nollywood has reached its peak.

鈥淎re we at the peak? Certainly not,鈥?Oni admits. 鈥淓ven Hollywood has not reached its peak. Growth is a common human phenomenon. You have to keep growing even beyond the skies.鈥?
An outstanding arts scholar, Prof. Oni鈥檚 marriage can be considered a work of the art: he met his wife at a national festival, FESTAC 鈥?7. He met beautiful and lovely Francesca, who is from Ogoja, Cross River State. After a seven-year courtship, they wedded in 1984 and together, they have four children: Yemi, Duro Jr., Dele, and Dolapo. They are all graduates of the University of Lagos. Oni and Francesca have four grandchildren.

鈥淵ou never really quit academics,鈥?says the professor not in a melancholic resignation to fate but in triumphal admission that he鈥檒l continue to conquer as many frontiers ahead of him as he repeats: 鈥淚t鈥檚 a calling and a lifelong career. By the grace of God and God sparing my life to witness it, I will retire from the service of the University of Lagos at 70 years on the 15 December 2022.鈥?
When the curtains come down, Prof. Oni wants to be remembered as 鈥渁 man who spent his time trying to be of assistance to his fellow human being鈥?"
"Undeterred by the COVID-19 rage and its attendant disruption of the social order, the Wole Soyinka International Cultural Exchange (WSICE) is set to hold its yearly programme, which usually coincides with the celebration of the birthday anniversary of an illustrious son of Africa and global citizen, Oluwole Akinwande Soyinka 鈥?the poet, dramatist and scholar, who is the 1986 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Every year for three days, the events of the WSICE are held across the country and other parts of the world with a live essay competition that draws participation from students of secondary schools and tertiary institutions, a cultural advocacy session, lectures, and symposium on humanity as well as poetry and theatrical performances.

This year, due to the peculiar circumstances of the pandemic, the WSICE will not be able to hold in a physical setting; but as is becoming the new normal, 鈥渨e will be operating in the digital space,鈥?stated Teju Kareem, the Executive Producer of the project and CEO of Zmirage.

According to Kareem, preparations are on for the event, which is organised by the Zmirage Multimedia Company. He added, the organisers would ensure that the events command quality attention and meet the same international standards that have earned the WSICE global respect in its over a decade existence.鈥?
This year, the events will run for three days, July 12 to 14.

The theme for the year鈥檚 project is: I Am Because You Are, which is drawn from Ubuntu, the Southern African philosophy which epitomises the principle of shared values that ensures the sustenance and survival of the human family.

Kareem said: 鈥淭he theme is inspired by observed factors and motives behind the responses of peoples and governments across the world to the challenges pushed forward by the rage of the pandemic. In particular, the obvious interdependence of our collective humanity has been brought to the fore in the way people and States have risen to support others experiencing the dire effects of the pandemic.鈥?
The main programme item, the Advocacy will run for two days, and will focus on the topic: Pandemic: Pursuit of individual Happiness and our common Humanity.

The first day (July 12) will feature the main conference paper by Prof Lilly Cheng of Chinese Cultural institute, San Diego University, USA, who would speak on the lead theme: I Am Because You Are, espousing on the interdependence of our collective humanity as evinced in the incidences and situations around the COVID-19 pandemics.

Cheng is a professor in the School of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences and Executive Director of Chinese Studies Institute at San Diego State University. She is also the Managing Director of the Confucius institute at SDSU.

She would be supported by Dr. Li Michael, an educator specialising in the teaching of the Chinese national treasure, the Abacus; President of Beijing Shenmo Education Group, which he founded in 1998, with its headquarter in Beijing, China.

Other speakers at the first session, who would be responding to Prof. Cheng鈥檚 presentation include: Shabaka Thompson (Trinidad & Tobago), a cultural leader with extensive experience in carnival, event management and production, working over three decades in Canada, Trinidad, Britain and Africa; and Keyna Eilson (Brazil), a curator, writer, researcher, heiress Griot and shaman, narrator, singer, ancient chronicler, and a member of the African Heritage Commission for laureation of the Valongo Wharf region as a World Heritage Site (UNESCO).

"A Chinese company, KEDI Healthcare, on Tuesday donated learning and feeding materials worth millions of naira to Bauchi state Orphans and Vulnerable Children Agency (BASOVCA) to alleviate the sufferings of children in the orphanage.

Manger, KEDI Healthcare in Bauchi, Anthony Yongo, said the donation was part of an outreach by the healthcare and a deliberate effort to contribute towards providing basic education to children in the state.

According to him, the gesture is part of the annual social responsibility programmes of the organisation for children in the state.

鈥淭his year we selected the orphanage home to provide orphans with incentives such as learning and feeding items.

Chairperson, BASOVCA, Mrs Hassana Arkila, commended the organisation for the gesture, describing it as a great move to bring succour to the orphanage.

She said that the learning materials would compliment government鈥檚 efforts in providing basic education for the children.

The officer commended KEDI Healthcare for identifying with them by bringing donations and describing it as a great service not only to the children but to the immediate society and humanity in general.

Arkila said that the present administration was focused on giving adequate education and care to the orphanage to ensure that the children were well placed in the society.

She said Bauchi state government had launched a strategic development plan (SDP) for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) activities in the state to ensure a better future for them. (NAN)"
"It is not in doubt that Governor Emeka Ihedioha is living up to his promise to holistically improve governance culture in Imo State. Besides his initiatives to revive the economy of the state, his resolve to revive the culture of Ndi Imo is gaining traction through the plan to bring back the hitherto abandoned Ahiajoku Lecture Series.

Without much ado, the inauguration of the Ahiajoku Lecture Series in 1979 can be regarded as one of the noblest achievements of the Sam Mbakwe administration, an administration generally adjudged as the best in the annals of the state.

The then governor used the lecture to remind Ndi Imo and indeed Ndi Igbo that they should not forget their culture in their socio-economic development. Mbakwe also used it to let Ndi Imo appreciate their rich cultural heritage. He demonstrated that governance can go side by side with cultural development. Mbakwe鈥檚 glorious administration had shown that good governance can only be achieved if based on the cultural imperatives of the people concerned.

The nexus between culture and development is well known and overtly documented. No society can really develop without its material culture. Great civilizations in history such as Western, Asian, Arabic and the Chinese have been modeled after their rich cultural background. Perhaps this was why the Sam Mbakwe administration established the Ahiajoku Lecture to serve as a think tank for the overall development of Imo State and by extension Igbo land.

Although Ahiajoku was formerly a cultural festival in honour of the god of yam and cocoyam, the major staples of Ndi Igbo, which culminated in the annual celebration of New Yam Festival in Igbo land, the Ahiajoku Lecture Series have transcended that ritual to embrace the projection of Igbo worldview through an annual intellectual harvest on some aspects of life in Igbo land including agriculture, economy, philosophy, art, religion and politics.

But whether Ahiajoku is celebrated in honour of the god of yam or as an intellectual harvest, it remains the veritable symbol of Igbo cultural ideal. In fact, it is one annual cultural celebration in which all Igbo are united including the Diaspora Igbo in West Indies and other places. It is one cultural celebration that survived colonialism, western education and religion tailored to denigrate and annihilate indigenous cultures. The mmonwu masquerade is another Igbo cultural icon that survived the colonial misadventure.

Unfortunately, the Ahiajoku Lecture Series suffered abject neglect in the hands of some administrations in the state notably the Col. Tanko Zubairu (rtd) and Rochas Okorocha administrations. Why that of Zubairu can be rationalized, nothing can explain why Okorocha, a cultural enthusiast, could abandon such worthy legacy of the Mbakwe administration. While the new bold initiative of the governor to revive the Ahiajoku Lecture Series is apt and commendable, it should go beyond its new mandate to accommodate some of the following suggestions.

Ahiajoku lecture can be used to enthrone a culture of transparency and accountability in governance. It can equally be used to improve the Igbo work ethic, belief system, mores and values, philosophy of live and let live, the extended family system as well as our social relations with other ethnic groups. Ahiajoku lecture can be used to check the pervading culture of crass materialism, greed and avarice in Igbo land as well as the escalating culture of anything goes and curb the current 鈥榙o or die鈥?approach to politics across the Igbo nation.

The Ahiajoku Institute, which is conceived as an extra-ministerial department of Imo State Government to harness all its cultural activities, is modeled after the Goethe Institute of Germany and the Instituto Italiano De Cultura of Italy. The Ahiajoku Institute will make Imo State a cultural hub where Nigerians and foreigners will meet annually to celebrate Ahiajoku.

Its envisaged functions include to organize the annual Ahiajoku Lecture Series, providing a programme of cultural events for the state and ensure that the state鈥檚 cultural potentials are properly harnessed and celebrated, engagement in cultural diplomacy by promoting the study of Igbo language and culture abroad as well as encouraging international cultural exchanges and relations as well as exchange of films, music, theatre and literature etc. I suggest that the Ahiajoku Institute can also incorporate some aspects of the Chinese Confucius institute now springing up in many Nigerian universities. Apart from whatever the government says the Ahiajoku Institute will do, it should be the purveyor and transmitter of Igbo culture, Igbo dance, films, arts and crafts. It should teach foreigners about Igbo foods, dishes and offer proficiency courses in Igbo language, especially courses tailored to meet the needs of foreign speakers of the language.

Efforts should be put in place to have Ahiajoku Institute in universities in Asia, Europe and America. The government of Imo State should turn into book or books past Ahiajoku lectures. There is indeed market for such publications. The first Ahiajoku Lecture entitled 鈥淎 Matter of Identity鈥?was delivered by Emeritus Professor of English, MJC Echeruo on November 30, 1979. It is instructive that 40 years later, the same Echeruo will deliver this year鈥檚 Ahiajoku Lecture scheduled to hold on November 30.

In the 1979 Ahiajoku lecture, Echeruo said much. The following are worth elaborate quoting: 鈥淲e celebrate Ahiajoku, not because it would be impossible to acknowledge the new yam without the festival but because we become a little more aware of the larger significance of that event for our lives by celebrating it. Ceremony takes the rough edges out of command iteration, and allows practical minded people such as the Igbo people are, a little respectable frivolity. For many other peoples, ceremony is at the very heart of culture. For them true culture is represented in these details of communal behavior which are added to pure function.鈥?
鈥淭he presentation of kola nut is a functional event in our society, but igo oji is a ceremony; and it is not uncommon to find commentators who assume that a people who devote some of their time to ceremony have a more genuine interest in culture than those who do not. There are absurdities in such conclusions, but it is probably true to say that it is to these details of ceremony that we have to go for concrete evidence of the life styles and values of any given society. The Igbo people, because they do not always cultivate ceremony, and are instinctively suspicious of mere decorativeness, are more liable than most other people to the charge of lacking culture and civilization.鈥?
鈥淭oday, as we celebrate Ahiajoku, we are doing at least two things; giving formal recognition to a festival which we were almost in danger of losing, and taking the opportunity for serious reflection on ways of understanding the deepest cultural values of the Igbo people.鈥?
Considering the standard Echeruo set in 1979, there is no doubt that the audience will be thrilled again. Past Ahiajoku lecturers include Prof. Bede Okigbo (1980), Prof. Adiele Afigbo (1981), Prof. Donatus Nwoga (1984) and Prof. Chinua Achebe (2008)."
"Nigerian teenager Samuel Miracle, was the winner of the World Chinese Bridge Language Competition. He beat 120 competitors from 105 countries in the world in the 2019 World Chinese Bridge Competition held in Henan Province, reported the News Agency of Nigeria.

The Chinese embassy in Abuja, presented Miracle to the media on Friday, with the award winner pledging to solve Nigeria鈥檚 electricity challenge after completing the scholarship he won to study Engineering in China.

However, a Facebook post by Nnamdi Azikiwe University, hosting the Confucius Centre, where Miracle learnt Chinese in less than a year, from 2018, said Miracle was the African champion at the competition.

鈥淢r.SAMUEL MIRACLE from our Confucius institute yesterday emerged African champion in the 12th Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign Secondary Students in China.

鈥淢r.SAMUEL, who learnt Chinese just for one year in our Confucius institute emerged African champion and the Top 5 in world. Congratulations鈥? said the university in a post dated 30 October..

Miracle said that the scholarship he won would be meaningless if he did not achieve something that would impact positively on the development of Nigeria.

Miracle explained that he decided to study the Chinese language in order to learn electrical engineering from China which is a developed country occupying a leading position in the world.

He promised to return to Nigeria after completing his scholarship programme to help tackle the problem of 鈥渂lackout鈥?

He said that the prize for winning the competition was a four-year fully-funded scholarship to any university/institution to study any course of his choice.

鈥淎fter my secondary education I went to study the Chinese language when I was introduced to the competition by a friend.

鈥淚 thought that it was a very good opportunity because it is a language I am really interested in.

鈥淏efore I started studying the Chinese language, I always had the dream of becoming an engineer and to be very good in it to help the electricity in sectors in Nigeria鈥檚 which is a big challenge.

鈥淚 will come back to impact in my country because you have not achieved the main goal of studying abroad if you do not return to your country to make an impact.

鈥淚 would do everything to help Nigeria, make a change where possible and correct the negative impression that other countries have about Nigeria鈥? Miracle said.

On winning the competition, Miracle said it was a great challenge as he only started studying Chinese at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University China Confucius institute in Oct. 2018.

He said that winning the competition was as a result of determination and the help of his teachers as he advised other youngsters of the advantages of being bilingual.

Miracle said that Nigeria and China had strong ties and it would be good for Nigerians to take learning Chinese language seriously to further promote the cultural ties with both countries.

Also speaking, Mr Zhang Jianle, Lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Conficius Institute commended Miracle who now bears the Chinese name Gu Siyan for his commitments to learning Chinese.

Jianle said that Miracle鈥檚 speed at learning the language was remarkable as a result of his determination.

He said that he was proud to be his teacher as he made the Institute which was participating in such category of the competition for the first time proud in winning the star prize.

Jianle urged the Nigerian institution to further build on the relations between Nigeria and China to introduce learning Chinese language in their curriculum especially from Primary School levels.

鈥淚t is important to learn Chinese language now because Chinese is getting stronger in the world and more Chinese companies are coming to Nigeria.

鈥淚t will help in deepening bilateral ties and interaction in order to enhance communications.

鈥淚t would be good to introduce Chinese in Nigerian schools. They have degree courses in Nnamdi Azikiwe University in Chinese Language but should also be introduced at primary level of education鈥? Jianle said.

Until 2019, the Chinese Bridge series of competitions has attracted more than 1.4 million teenagers from more than 150 countries and region across the world.

More than 6,500 students from more than 110 countries were invited to China to participate in the World Chinese Bridge rematch and finals.

Last year, another Nigerian with Chinese name Ding Jiaming, a Student of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Confucius Center also won the African Championship of the 17th World University Chinese Bridge Competition"
"According to him, there has been a lot misunderstanding between Nigerians and Chinese due to lack of openness, issues of mindset and language inhibitions.

We are really working at how best to create more understanding between Nigerians and the Chinese. We want to trust the Chinese as much as we want the Chinese to trust us.

The Institute of Nigeria-China Development Studies in UNILAG, therefore, wants to establish a Nigerian-Chinese Experience Centre where Nigerians and the Chinese can interact freely for a better understanding of themselves.

Through this centre, our one-on-one interaction would strongly be enhanced. And we can begin to know ourselves better, rather than have biases for ourselves, he said.

Sabiu advised Nigerians to avail themselves of the opportunities currently being offered by the Confucius institute in Nigeria to learn to communicate in Chinese Mandarin language.

The professor of Economics also said that it was important for the Chinese to begin to learn to communicate in Ibo, Hausa and Yoruba languages, for easier business and personal interaction with Nigerians.

Just as the Chinese are today coming to teach us their language, Nigeria should also create a centre in China to teach the Chinese to speak Nigerian languages.

This way, the Chinese can learn to speak Ibo, Hausa and Yoruba languages in China, before coming to do business with Nigerians, he said."
"A Professor of English Language, University of Lagos (UniLag), Prof. Chimdi Maduagwu, Wednesday called on the federal government to apply the Chinese 鈥淐ulture to Technology鈥? that is, technology derived from that country鈥檚 culture to improve the nation鈥檚 economy.

Maduagwu, who is also the Director, Confucius institute of UniLag, made the the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos at the institute鈥檚 2019 Spring and Latern Festival.

NAN reports that Confucius institute, the centre for the study of Chinese Language, has trained about 10,000 Nigerians in Chinesew language.

He said that culture to technology was one crusade we have to carry out in Nigeria.

According to him, China as a country developed from culture to technology and this we have not realised as a country because we go through the part of the West which is from science to technology but China developed from culture to technology.

鈥淐hina is a highly traditional society and then has its own culture and a journey of a thousand miles begins with a step, and that is culture.

鈥淭echnology is how do you take this step and what can help you in making the step faster instead of going to do the mathematics which becomes abstract.

鈥淐hina will look at the Chinese porcelain from the point of view of clay.

鈥淚t is our culture to play with clay and not interested in the molecular formation then twisted in the beauty of clay and how to use the clay in various aspects,鈥?he said.

He said that the Chinese would go ahead to make a pot and try to improve on it to make sure it meets their aesthetic vision.

The professor said that analysing did not relate to our culture and it had stalled development and that it was the reason for the advocacy of culture to technology.

鈥淢y advice is that since we are now working with the belt and roll initiative, we will learn how they have done theirs.

鈥淲e found out that we have common interest and shared interest and we also have a common vision.

鈥淭hat human being essentially have specific needs that are universal and specific vision of meeting the needs should also be universal.

鈥淚t is through this process that poverty will be eradicated,鈥?he said.

Prof. Wang Yong Jing, Chinese Director of the institute, said that the benefit of learning Chinese language was more for Nigeria.

She said the country鈥檚 economy would also benefit because the students could apply for scholarship in China.

鈥淚 hope that all of them when they finish their study in China and return, they will be big builders of the economy.

鈥淏ut if they do not go to China to study many of our students can apply to local Chinese enterprise to work there, so at the same time they are working for both countries and the economic development.

鈥淲e hope to help in the economy but we are focusing on the language and the language culture.

鈥淚 am sure that Nigerians when they study Chinese culture and language they can become better friends,鈥?she said.

According to her, this friendship can help the economy because many more Chinese enterprises are coming and many more students can work with them and just because of this friendship we can help in other fields.

"Nigeria, and at least 60 other countries are eager to embrace the benefits from the various economic opportunities being offered by The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The BRI is a development strategy being used by the Chinese Government, including infrastructure and investments in countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa.

The idea was formulated by Xi Jinping in 2013, as One Belt and One Road Initiative, and later changed to The Belt and Road Initiative, in 2016.

Nigeria officially entered into the BRI through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, in September, last year.

President of China, Xi Jinping at the signing ceremony asserted that Nigeria becoming a member of BRI would further strengthen China-Nigeria bilateral relations.

However, the initiative has been limited to few sectors in Nigeria, either through ignorance or lack of information.

The development informed the recent 鈥淔orum on the Belt and Road Initiative and Production Capacity Co-operation Between China and Nigeria,鈥?organised by the Chinese Government in Lagos.

Consul General of the Chinese Embasy in Lagos, Chao Xiaoliang, in his welcome address, hinged the MoU on the strong relationship between the two countries, describing it as a stage of growth unmatched in history.

He disclosed that the Beijing Summit was focused on eight initiatives, including which industrial promotion, infrastructural connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, health care, people-to-people exchange and peace as well as security.

He added that the implementation of these eight major initiatives could only be strengthened by deeper exchanges and discussions between Chinese and Nigerian government institutions, business communities, think-tanks, cultural circles and others.

鈥淥nly in this way, we can put forward a sustainable, practical and inclusive co-operation, road map and shared vision鈥?he said.

The Ambassador of China to Nigeria, Zhou Pingjian, who expressed satisfaction with attendance at the forum, said China was making history in Nigeria, not only because of readiness to tap into BRI, but because the two countries have a lot of things in common.

BRI created the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), with capital base of $100billion to finance infrastructure and other related projects in Asia and other beneficiary countries, which only South Africa, and Egypt from Africa have been tapping from.

For instance, Pakistan, through BRI, was able to strike a deal of $62billion in projects scheduled along the China-Pakistan Economic corridor, equivalent of 21% of Pakistani gross domestic product (GDP). This has not only yielded dramatic long-term impact on her domestic economy and businesses, but also scaled energy capacity to 9,000MW representing 50% increase in the country鈥檚 energy output to woo investors.

In Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Nigeria are now poised to tap into the BRI opportunity.

At the Lagos forum, the Vice Chancellor, Nanmdi Azikiwe University, Prof. Joseph Ahaneku, disclosed how students from the institution acquired scholarship through China鈥檚 benevolence.

He lauded the vast opportunities BRI has made available for students, and expressed the University鈥檚 readiness to continue to leverage them with a view to strengthening ties with China for the benefit of more students.

Also, the Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, who lauded the BRI, disclosed of China鈥檚 establishment of the Confucius institute, where Chinese Language and culture are already being taught and promoted.

He solicited the building of a skyscraper of about seven floors within the campus, to strengthen the already mutual relationship between the University and Republic of China.

Similarly, the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, disclosed that The BRI has created a platform and opportunity for Nigeria to leverage.

He expressed the preparedness of his State to accommodate every development that the Initiative brings, declaring an open door for investment.

The Deputy Governor, Ekiti State, Chief Adebisi Adegboyega Egbeyemi, also his expressed readiness to tap into available opportunities by making adequate preparation for BRI鈥檚 operation in the State.

Former Director-General, Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Dr. Bola Akinterinwa, praised China

for opening its doors for other nations to benefit from the BRI.

"China Town, a Chinese dominated business arena in Oworonsoki-Ojota area of Lagos is set to receive a conspicuous facelift that would spur economic development in Lagos State. The giant shopping centre will no longer be for only economic activities, it will also to facilitate a robust bilateral relationship between Nigerians and the Chinese people.

Established in 2001 with the vision of facilitating foreign direct investment between China and Nigeria, China Town is the commercial home of everything Chinese. It is recognized by the local government as an independent trade market. With 300 shops and 200 apartment units, the market is patronized by Chinese and Nigerians alike for China made products.

In China Town, a buyer is sure to get the best of Chinese clothes, electronics, fashions accessories, food and the like. With the new development, China Town will not just do more business, but would deepen the China-Nigeria friendship as well as minimize the hurdles new Chinese investors in Nigeria are likely to face.

Speaking to journalists recently, during a facility tour of the arena, Mr. Liu Chang鈥檃n, the General Manager of China Town, spoke of his vision to turn the place into a vibrant economic hub for quality Chinese products. He believes that having been in existence in the last 18 years, China Town should serve as a symbol of cultural and economic exchange between Nigeria and China.

Giving a brief history of the business arena, he noted that the town came into existence a year after the creation of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). With FOCAC getting stronger and the Chinese and Nigerians knowing to enjoy a deeper friendships, he added it was not wise to allow China Town get into decline.

鈥淚 have a dream to turn things around for the better in the China Town because the centre has become a landmark not just in the city but in the cultural, economic and personal relationship between China and Nigeria, and we should not allow it go down.

鈥淪oon, the signs announcing China Town to someone driving through the Oworonsoki-Ojota highway would be too conspicuous to miss,鈥?he explained.

He said that China Town currently undergoing a serious rebranding and that in the next few months, it would take a complete different look giving the structural transformation currently going on. He further said that the centre would not just be a business place, but a cultural centre with a library for scholars serving people who want to learn about the Chinese way of life as well as giving the Chinese in Nigeria, the Nigerian way of life.

Lui, who is also the founder of the Institute of Nigeria China Development Studies at the University of Lagos, expressed his commitment to building trade and economic ties with Nigeria by bringing and selling genuine Chinese products in China Town. 鈥淲e are really concerned with this fake product as that was the major reason why businesses in China Town have declined in recent time.鈥?Continuing, he said: 鈥淲e are repositioning the China Town to ensure that only genuine products are supplied and sold. We are committed to developing China Town into an exhibition centre for well-known and quality products and a hub for trade, investment, recreation, culture activities and food.

He noted that corresponding to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China Town is taking the lead in building the new era of comprehensive cooperation between China and Nigeria. 鈥淭hrough cooperation with Nigeria state governments, we will be able to provide consulting services including finance, taxation, immigration, insurance, etc, to Chinese in Nigeria and also to Nigerians for everything which is related to China.鈥?He further noted: 鈥淎s you can see from this tour, a lot of innovation is going on and I can assure you that in no longer time, China Town will develop into a wholesale mall focusing on middle and high-end market selling and distributing hardware, bathroom ware, building materials, small and medium-sized equipment and auto parts that imports from China. With the support of our political connections and business resources here in Nigeria, China Town will form and train competent sales teams to develop distribution networks in major cities in Nigeria, promptly responding to the demand of clients.鈥?
Commenting on revamping, culture, recreation and food centre, Liu said: 鈥淭he Chinese schools and libraries in the China Town have been inaugurated and are accepting enrolees. We are working closely with the Confucius institute at University of Lagos and use their teaching advantages to spread Chinese culture and strengthen relationship between the two countries. There are also hotels, supermarkets and restaurants here. We are determined to turn the China Town into a commercial centre with Chinese characteristics, at the same time covering wholesale markets, leisure, shopping and dining. All brands entering the mall must pass our screening to ensure product quality.鈥?
鈥淐hina makes the best quality products for the global market and is the highest exporter of consumer goods in the world. Our government and private investors are becoming more and more interested in Nigeria and we want to be part of that project by giving the Nigerian consumer the quality of products we would all be proud of.

Entrusted as the general manager of China Town early this year, Liu assured that he is committed to achieving his dream for China Town. In his words, 鈥渕y plan is to totally change that notion in the market that Chinese products are of inferior quality. So, as we raise the quality of the products imported into China Town and also create an avenue for the Nigerian products of good quality.鈥?
According to Mr. Lui, 鈥渨e make stronger our bonds and through that make it possible for more Chinese investors to get the right persuasion to manufacture in Nigeria in the future and not just exporting products into the country.

鈥淲hat China Town provides to its clients is not only shop fronts and showroom windows but also access to share local resources of HUAFEI Mall, like our sales team, foreign trade experience, distribution channels and publicity network,鈥?he noted.

Mr Lui also disclosed that the management of China Town in Lagos has begun negotiations with some state governments on ways to attract direct investment as part of measures to attract huge investment by Chinese investors into the country and boost economic ties.

鈥淲e have started negotiations with Osun State government to see how to attract Chinese investors into the state to establish factories there. This will help to eliminate sub-standard products being imported into the country and at the same time, help create employment.

鈥淢ost of the things we target to do is creating the right image and bond between the Chinese businessman in Lagos, Nigeria and entire Africa. Our objective is to make sure that we work with the best brands and manufacturers in China and bring their products here and even convince them to open up business outlets in Nigeria for manufacturing.鈥?
Liu, who has been in Nigeria for almost 20 years, is the chairman of the Association of Chinese Investors in Nigeria and the Chief Executive Officer of HuaFei Group of Companies. He expressed a strong desire to build a better China-Nigeria relationship when he sets up the Institute of Nigeria China Development Studies at the University of Lagos."

Margee Ensign in 1992, wrote in her book, Doing Good or Doing Well, to assess Japan鈥檚 foreign aid program then. Ensign raised once again the question in diplomatic studies that draws a parallel between 鈥榙oing good鈥?and 鈥榙oing well鈥? 鈥楧oing Good鈥?is charity service or so-called selfless service where one renders assistance and walks away without waiting for any returns. 鈥楧oing Well鈥?is what China in relating with Africa aptly describes as 鈥榳in鈥檞in鈥? In diplomacy of course, no country does 鈥榞ood鈥? All they do is 鈥榳ell鈥? because the doer is also a stakeholder and has an intention to benefit, at least in goodwill and friendship.

I think we getting this right at the beginning would help our perception of the multilateral relationship between China and Africa, especially on the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) platform that is 19 years old now. Today, at the centre of such global issues as Japan faced then is China. It emphasises so much on Chinese loans to African countries, the motives and how they enslave or re-colonize Africa. This slant also worries China as many Chinese journalists during in interviews in the country have asked me this question many times and what Africa thinks about it. My answer remained the same 鈥?if Africa allows China to recolonize her today, then Africa is miserable and should blame herself for such unfathomable folly. But a closer look at the details of the relationship between the two sides would show if it has all been just loans and re-enslavement of Africa by China or if the Asian economic giant has been of any good impact in the development of the human capital of Africa which is the best way to make lasting input in the future of a people.

On July 31, 2018, as the Confucius institute of the University of Lagos held its graduation and job fair, the body of Chinese investors in Nigeria announced the award of scholarships to about 63 students of the university to study in Chinese institutions. While some of them were for short programmes, most were for first degree and second degree courses with all the bills paid. That development was part of the consolidation of the growing links between China and Africa and by extension, with Nigeria.

However, four months after, the same institute in liaison with the investors body took up a challenge the Vice Chancellor of the university had thrown at them to establish more links with the university for better relationship. That day in November, the university鈥檚 Nigeria-China Development Studies Institute was established.

In Nigeria also, on April 12, 2018, in Abuja, the Chinese construction giant, CCECC held career workshop for some Nigerian fresh university graduates immediately after their one year national service. The outcome of the training was an immediate employment of 50 of them in that firm. The management of the company had said it was one of the first steps for large scale employment of Nigerians in the system and ensuring that Nigerians have good skilled labour presence in the company.

At the middle of May 2019, during a visit to the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr. Zhou Pinjian in Abuja, his secretary during a discussion revealed that the number of Nigerian students in Chinese universities on scholarship as at last year is more than 6500. Moreover, CNN reported in June 2017 that; 鈥楾he surge in the number of African students in China is remarkable. In less than 15 years the African student body has grown 26-fold 鈥?from just under 2,000 in 2003 to almost 50,000 in 2015. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the US and UK host around 40,000 African students a year. China surpassed this number in 2014, making it the second most popular destination for African students studying abroad, after France which hosts just over 95,000 students.

鈥楾his dramatic increase in students from Africa can be explained in part by the Chinese government鈥檚 targeted focus on African human resource and education development. Starting in 2000, China鈥檚 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summits have promised financial and political support for African education at home and abroad in China.

Since 2006, China has set scholarship targets to aid African students coming to China for study. For example, at the most recent 2015 summit, China pledged to provide 30,000 scholarships to African students by 2018.鈥?Taking it in sectors, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping had pledged in Johannesburg in 2015 at the FOCAC summit that the country would host about 10,000 African journalists in exchange trainings in 2016 alone.

While on tour of Shandong Province as journalism Fellows of the China Public Diplomacy, 2016, we visited companies in Qingdao in September and one of the points of call was a power company where the management received us with 50 African students. They were later introduced to us as Zimbabweans studying in universities in the province on the scholarship of the company. In fact, one of us, a Zimbabwean, interacted with and recognized some of them.

At the Sinotruk headquarters in Jinan, capital city of Shandong, I met Mr. Zhang Yuzong, Executive Director, Africa Division, who told me he would be travelling to Nigeria two months later for the commencement of their production at a Lagos factory in partnership with the Dangote Group. And in March of the following year, I attended a seminar on investment by Chinese investors and their Nigerian counterparts alongside the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria, during which we toured the truck assembly plant within the Lekki Free Trade Zone, Lagos, a multi-billion dollar project powered by Chinese investors and Dangote. The mega project is not about loans.

Another important report by the africanews.com reflected that; China鈥檚 direct investment in Africa soared by 64 percent, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday. Sun Jiwen, spokesman at the ministry outlined that this recent rise is linked to China鈥檚 change in trade policies in 2015. China鈥檚 total trade with Africa rose 16.8 percent to $38.8 billion in the first quarter, its first quarterly increase on a yearly basis since 2015, Sun said during a regular news briefing in Beijing.鈥?
The report examines the relationship between the 鈥渄ragons鈥濃€擟hinese firms investing in Africa鈥攁nd the 鈥渓ions鈥濃€擜frican economies receiving Chinese investment. Through face-to-face interviews with 1073 Chinese firms across eight African countries鈥擜ngola, C么te d鈥橧voire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia鈥擬cKinsey explored the current and future plans of different Chinese businesses there.

Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company published a report entitled 鈥淒ance of the lions and dragons,鈥?which analyzes the current and long-term trajectory of Chinese engagement in Africa, noting that China has become Africa鈥檚 biggest economic partner over the past two decades. In fact, presently, more than 10,000 Chinese firms are conducting business operations on the continent. According to the report, 74 percent of surveyed Chinese firms feel optimistic and confident about investing in Africa. Relatedly, most investments by Chinese firms reflect long-term commitments to Africa.

The features show that 63 percent of the investments made by the surveyed Chinese firms in Africa require long-term commitments, while 26 percent are low-commitment. Indeed, 44 percent of the surveyed firms have made capital-intensive investments鈥攖he hardest investments to reverse. These investments tend to come in the form of factory acquisitions and the purchase of manufacturing equipment. Conversely, trade and non-labour-intensive contracting investments (e.g., telecommunications) are the easiest investments to extract and comprise a smaller proportion of investments by Chinese firms in sub-Saharan Africa.鈥?
Emewu, journalist and of the Afri-China Media Centre writes from Lagos"
"Josfyn Uba

China Town, a Chinese-dominated business arena in the Ojota area of Lagos, is set to receive a conspicuous facelift that would spur economic development in the state.

The giant shopping centre, which sits on an expanse of land measuring 20,000 square metres, will no longer be for only economic activities. It will also help facilitate robust bilateral relationships between Nigerians and the Chinese people.

Established in 2001 with the vision of facilitating foreign direct investment between China and Nigeria, China Town is the commercial home of everything Chinese. It is recognised by the local government as an independent trade market. With 300 shops and 200 apartment units, the market is patronised by the Chinese and Nigerians for China-made products. In China Town, a buyer is sure to get the best of Chinese clothes, electronics, fashion, accessories, food and the likes. With the latest arrangements, China Town will not just do more business, the facility would deepen China-Nigeria friendship as well as minimise the hurdles that new Chinese investors in Nigeria are likely to face.

During a recent facility tour of the arena, Mr. Liu Chang鈥檃n, the General Manager of China Town, spoke of his vision to turn the place to an economic hub for quality Chinese products. He asserted that, having been in existence in the last 18 years, China Town should serve as a symbol of cultural and economic exchange between Nigeria and China.

Giving a brief history of the business arena, he noted that the town came into existence a year after the creation of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). With FOCAC getting stronger, and with the peoples of China and Nigeria enjoying deeper friendship, he said it would be unwise to allow China Town fall into decline.

鈥淚 have a dream to turn things around for the better in China Town, because the centre has become a landmark, not just in the city, but in the cultural, economic and personal relationship between China and Nigeria, and we should not allow it go down.

鈥淪oon, the signs announcing China Town to someone driving through the Oworonsoki-Ojota highway would be too conspicuous to miss,鈥?he said.

He noted that China Town was currently undergoing serious rebranding, adding that, in the next few months, the centre would wear a completely different look. He pledged that the centre would not just be a business place, it would be a cultural centre, with a library for scholars serving people who want to learn about the Chinese way of life. It would equally teach the Chinese in Nigeria the Nigerian way of life.

Lui, who is also the founder of the Institute of Nigeria China Development Studies at the University of Lagos, expressed his commitment to building trade and economic ties with Nigeria by selling genuine Chinese products in China Town.

"Ranked 148 out of 163 least peaceful countries

Akinwale Akintunde

Nigeria is one of the least peaceful places on earth, says 2019 Global Peace Index (GPI) report, despite claims by the All Progressives Congress-led government of President Muhammadu Buhari that the country is better than they met in 2015.

The country, battling with banditry, economic stagnation, insurgency, kidnapping and an increasing rate of suicides, is ranked 148 out of 163 countries in the world.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria sits among the top five least peaceful countries in the region alongside, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan.

The GPI measures peacefulness across three domains: safety and security, ongoing conflict, and militarization. It pointed out that while the world has become less peaceful over the last decade, there have been some notable improvements in peace.

The GPI also analyzed the potential long-term impact of climate change on levels of peacefulness. An estimated 971 million people live in areas with high or very high exposure to climate hazards.

Of this number, 400 million or 41 percent, reside in countries with already low levels of peacefulness. Climate change can indirectly increase the likelihood of violent conflict through its impacts on resource availability, livelihood security, and migration.

Eight of the 25 least peaceful countries have ten percent or more of their population in high climate hazard areas, amounting to 103.7 million people at risk. These countries are South Sudan, Iraq, Libya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, North Korea, Nigeria, and Mexico.

Yet, the report recorded some cheering news for the so-called African giant, saying Nigeria鈥檚 improvement was based on a reduction in deaths from internal conflict.

The report said, 鈥淪afety and security was sub-Saharan Africa鈥檚 least peaceful domain and recorded the largest deterioration last year. While 18 countries improved, 24 deteriorated.

鈥淭he likelihood of violent demonstrations deteriorated most significantly, followed by the impact of terrorism. The incarceration rate rose on average last year, as did the homicide rate and perceptions of criminality.

However, the report stated that in a place like Nigeria, 鈥渆xperiences of sadness, stress, and worry are on the rise regardless of peace levels鈥?

It added: 鈥淚n the past decade, 77 countries experienced increased sadness whilst only 20 decreased in experiences of sadness. Of those that increased in sadness, 44 had a corresponding deterioration in peace level.

鈥淥f those that decreased in sadness, 60 percent recorded a corresponding increase in peacefulness. Less than half of the countries that improved in stress and worry levels had corresponding improvements in their GPI scores.鈥?
The report noted that the world is considerably less peaceful now than it was in 2008, with the average level of country peacefulness deteriorating by 3.78 percent over the last decade.

It added that peacefulness had declined year-on-year for seven of the last 10 years.

鈥淪ince 2008, 81 countries have become less peaceful, compared to 81 that have improved.

It admitted that most of the deterioration in peacefulness over the last decade occurred in the MENA region. If this region was excluded from the analysis, the average level of peace in the world would only have deteriorated by 0.95 percent.

鈥淓ven within the MENA region, the deterioration in the last decade was concentrated in a handful of countries, most notably Syria, Libya, Yemen, Egypt, and Bahrain,鈥?the GPI pointed out.

Results in sub-Saharan Africa were mixed last year across both indicators and countries. Twenty-seven of the region鈥檚 44 countries deteriorated in peacefulness, leading to a weakening of all three domains of the GPI, while 12 of the region鈥檚 23 indicators improved and eight deteriorated.

The region鈥檚 five largest country improvements were in Rwanda, The Gambia, Djibouti, Eswatini, and Somalia. Improvement in internal conflicts fought boosted Somalia by one place in the 2019 GPI to rank 158, lifting it out of the five least peaceful countries in the world. The five worst deteriorations occurred in Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Togo, Sierra Leone and Namibia.

Militarisation was the region鈥檚 most peaceful domain, and the only one in which it outperforms the global average, although it deteriorated slightly last year because of reductions in UN peacekeeping funding and increases in nuclear and heavy weapons and the armed services personnel rate."

Vice Chancellor, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Prof Charles Esimone has disclosed that the Chinese Language and training centre, Confucius institute, domiciled in the university has grown from a mere centre for teaching of language and culture to a centre for building capacities in diverse disciplines.

Esimone who made the disclosure at the weekend during the 10th anniversary celebration of the establishment of the institute in Unizik said his vision is for the university 鈥渢o capitalize on its relationship with the institute to train people in different areas, even in manufacturing, equipment maintenance, ICT, Engineering and Mass Communication among others.

He said the Chinese have graciously cooperated with the university to achieve those lofty aims noting that within the last one decade of blossoming relationship, the university now offers Chinese Language Studies both at diploma and degree levels.

The newly elected Vice Chancellor recalled that the institute was a memorandum of understanding between the Chinese Language Council International (HANBAN) and Xiamen University on one hand and Nnamdi Azikiwe University on the other hand"
"Consular General in Lagos, Chinese Embassy, Chao Xiaoliang has expressed satisfaction at the relationship between Nigeria and China on the 47th anniversary of both countries鈥?diplomatic relations, which he said, has culminated into trade volume accruing to 14 billion dollars as at 2017.

He said this yesterday at the opening ceremony of the Chinese language training programme for Nigerian Immigration officials which took place in University of Lagos.

Xiaoliang lauded the joint efforts of both countries, which have yielded fruitful achievements from friendly and mutually beneficial co-operation in all fields. According to him, more and more investment from China come to Nigeria while people exchange between the two countries becomes more and more frequent.

He remarked that Nigerian Immigration Service issued more than 14,000 visas to Chinese citizens, which recorded the third among all the foreign countries.

He noted the great importance the Comptroller General of Nigerian Immigration service, Mr. Muhammed Banbandede attached to the programme as he also appreciated University of Lagos especially the Confucius institute for their co-operation. Babandede said the teaching of Mandarin was actually aimed at enhancing the capacity and abilities of Immigration Officers to interact with Chinese and other nationals at Nigeria鈥檚 various border posts and entry points."

"Solomon Elusoji chronicles the path of Zhang Weiwei, a Chinese, who was re-christened Murtala after the late General Murtala Muhammed. Weiwei鈥檚 passion for languages, especially the Hausa language, which he broadcasts in, reflects a shining example of China鈥檚 increasing engagement with African languages.

Foreign languages have always fascinated Zhang 鈥楳urtala鈥?Weiwei. He grew up in Nanjing, a city in South-east China famous for its central role in the ancient Ming dynasty and proximity to Shanghai. And he remembers a childhood filled with pleasant experiences; a member of China鈥檚 one-child policy generation, he was an only child. 鈥淚 really enjoyed my childhood,鈥?he says.

When it was time for him to go to university, in 2004, he decided to study a foreign language. His parents did not object. 鈥淭hey respected my choice.鈥?
The foreign language he really wanted to learn was Spanish, at Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU), but the school offered him another language, Hausa. 鈥淎t that point, to be honest, I had never heard about Hausa,鈥?Murtala says, 鈥淚 didn鈥檛 even know how to spell the word.鈥?But BFSU鈥檚 prestige as one of the best foreign language schools in the China was too much for Murtala to resist. He accepted the offer and quickly realized, after doing a quick Baidu search, that Hausa was widely spoken in Nigeria, a country whose oil wealth and footballing pedigree he was already familiar with. He didn鈥檛 know, then, that some nine years later, work would take him to its West African shores.

For four years, Murtala studied Hausa at BFSU. The name 鈥楳urtala鈥?was give to him by one of his professors, Balarabe Shehu, a Nigerian instructor. 鈥淢y Chinese name 鈥榃eiwei鈥?can be translated to mean great, so he decided to name me after a great man in Nigerian politics, Murtala Muhammed.鈥?His other professors were Chinese, but they had all studied Hausa in West Africa, most at the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. In 2008, he graduated from BFSU and joined the Hausa Service at China Radio International (CRI), one of the largest multi-language broadcasters in the world.

In 2013, Murtala was posted to Nigeria as a Chief Correspondent for CRI. The first thing that hit him, as he alighted from the aircraft at the Nnamdi Azikwe Airport in Abuja, was the hot wind. But, inside the terminal and beyond, he felt at home hearing the language he had learnt for almost a decade being spoken in casual conversations. 鈥淓verything felt familiar,鈥?he says. 鈥淢y driver, a man from Nasarawa, was familiar. From that day, I fell in love with the country.鈥?
Murtala鈥檚 job as a reporter in Nigeria brought him in contact with a lot of local people. And wherever he went, people were shocked that he could speak Hausa. The idea that a Chinese man was Hausa-fluent was almost unimaginable; perhaps he was not real. But he was there, in the flesh; the evidence could not be thrown out. Once, he was designated to interview the Emir of Kano, Lamido Sanusi. A day before the interview, the Emir鈥檚 handlers were worried he might not be able to pay proper respects to the Emir in the local language. He proved them wrong. A five-minute interview was extended to more than twenty, as the Emir praised his fluency. It was one of Murtala鈥檚 proudest moments during his time in Nigeria. 鈥淚 couldn鈥檛 believe I could get a chance to get close to such a dignified personality,鈥?he says.

He worked in Nigeria for almost four years, during which he interviewed several important personalities across the country. But he was also interviewed by a lot of people. Everyone wanted to know the story behind the Chinese man who could speak Hausa. He appeared on television shows and within the lines of newspaper articles. When he left the country, he wrote a blog for a national newspaper expressing his profound gratitude to all the locals who had helped him navigate the past years.

The bewildering reactions to Murtarla鈥檚 Hausa-fluency are a pointer to how little contact there is between Nigerian languages and Chinese. This reporter, who recently spent ten months in China, had similar experiences. Without even a basic grasp of Chinese, a simple 鈥楴ihao鈥?(Hello) drew gasps from most Chinese people 鈥?a Nigerian who can say 鈥楴ihao鈥?is a unicorn. But that might be changing too, as China ramps up the promotion of Chinese language and culture across the world through initiatives such as the Confucius institute.

But the reactions can also show how little we value our local languages. If a foreigner lives and works in a place, should he not be expected to communicate in the tongue of the locals? 鈥淲e no longer teach local languages in the country, in our secondary and primary schools, which is a shame,鈥?Mr. Kola Tubosun, a linguist, told this reporter in an email. 鈥淣ot only that, we rarely speak these languages to our children anymore.鈥?
Mr. Tubosun, who has emerged as, perhaps, the most important language advocate in the country within the past half-decade, was responding to a question about the quality of local language promotion in the country, compared to China鈥檚.

鈥淐hina is doing something right,鈥?he said. 鈥淏ut the reason why they succeed has nothing to do with our own nonchalance. We can acquire as many languages as we choose to. The question is why we aren鈥檛 as proactive as they are. For China, there is an economic incentive to teach Africans their language. They want to exploit our economic opportunities. Maybe when we find out what we want to do in the world, how we want to exploit the benefits in other lands, then we will use our language as an entry point as well.鈥?
When Murtala was asked whether he thought Nigerians were doing enough to promote their local languages, he acknowledged that a lot needed to be done. 鈥淭he colonial language 鈥?English 鈥?has had a very big influence,鈥?he says. When the locals speak Hausa, he notes, it is riddled with a lot of English words and phrases. 鈥淣igerians have to make the teaching of local languages compulsory in schools, starting from the primary education. On our part as Chinese people, we translate so many TV shows and series into Hausa and we also broadcast in the language. That鈥檚 our way of encouraging the people to develop their language.鈥?
This reporter first met Murtala last May during a function at Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU). He had been transferred back to China and was happy to see a Nigerian. When he realized this reporter wasn鈥檛 fluent in Hausa, he said a greeting in Yoruba. Over the course of the interviews for this article, which was conducted once in person at CRI headquarters in Beijing and via exchanged messages on social media, Murtala was quick to show basic competency in several local Nigerian languages, including Idoma and Igbo. 鈥淢y cleaner when I was in Nigeria was Idoma,鈥?he says.

He reminisces about his time in Nigeria, where he made a lot of friends 鈥?some still send him messages on Facebook 鈥?and enjoyed pap and akara, and spicy suya. 鈥淢y understanding of Hausa gave me more access to the local people,鈥?he says, 鈥渁 lot of people want me to return.鈥?
The relationship between Nigeria and China, during the past decade, has grown tremendously both in economic and political terms. China is now the country鈥檚 largest trade partner and people-to-people exchange numbers are rising. But it is not a relationship without its question marks, despite stable and cordial diplomatic engagements at the highest levels. Worth mentioning is perception of the other among average people. Namvula Rennie, in an article in the Journal of African Media Studies, notes that some Chinese tend to distrust Nigerians, ascribing to them notions of criminality, including illegal drug trafficking.

Since he has returned, Murtala has had to fend off untrue, blanket opinions about Nigeria or Africa held by people he meets. 鈥淚 tend to defend Africa,鈥?he says. 鈥淚 tell them 鈥榶ou don鈥檛 know my life in Abuja or Kano鈥?鈥?This is why, he admits, more people-to-people exchanges are important for the promotion of a better relationship between both parties. The more we interact with each other, the more we can bring about 鈥渕ore mutual understanding,鈥?he says.

During conversations with this reporter, it was easy to observe that Murtala had assimilated a lot of Nigerian-ness, finishing sentences with 鈥榳e thank God鈥? Of course, Murtala is not religious (鈥淚 am a communist鈥?, but such religious sentences are woven into the fabric of most Nigerian languages and, in extension, the country鈥檚 psychological framework. 鈥淟anguage,鈥?Murtala says, 鈥渙pens a new window."
"The Director, Confucius institute, University of Lagos, Prof. Yongjing Wang, has lauded Chinese government鈥檚 efforts at providing platform for citizens around the world to connect and learn Chinese language and culture, in order to position them for scholarships and opportunities in the country鈥檚 tertiary institutions.

Wang, who stated this while hosting the management of Jextoban Secondary School, which represented Nigeria at the Chinese Bridge Language Proficiency Competition held in China in October, said the initiative creates a bridge for students around the world.

Wang said: 鈥淭he first impression they have is so beautiful, and China has come to be such a stage of the world where everyone wants to come to. Secondly, after competing with people, they can also discover the beauty of the language and culture. We always say in China, children are the hope of the future; we have to depend on our children to develop our country and our future, because when they go outside and see something different they come back to their motherland and replicate what they have seen.鈥?
Wang also said it was the Nigerian people that demanded for the Institute, to learn about the Chinese people and tradition, which are very similar to what we have in Africa and Nigeria. Ultimately, this will help the two countries in the area of doing business.

Mr. Dayo Ojo, Director of the school, while appreciating Wang for the opportunity, expressed hope that the Institute would open more opportunities for the country.

"It was an evening of songs, dance and entertainment as students of Jiangxi Normal University, China, wowed guests at the main hall of the University of Lagos, Akoka. The Chinese musical concert, which brought together the university students, including secondary schools, witnessed a large turnout of lovers of the Chinese culture.

The hall was full to the brim as students excitedly watched each performance while cheering the artistes even though they barely understood the lyrics of the songs. After every performance, the compere took the time to explain the concept behind every song, which encouraged the audience to look forward to another performance.

All the sonorous performances by both male and female singers alike had the accompaniment of well-choreographed movements and Chinese indigenous instruments.

While speaking at the concert, which held last weekend, Deputy Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos, Prof. Duro Oni, said the musical concert by the Jiangxi Normal University, China, is a welcome development for UNILAG, as the visitors have come all the way to celebrate with them ahead of its convocation ceremonies.

鈥淲ith our convocation ceremonies holding from January 23 through 26, 2017, this musical concert comes as a prelude to the convocation and since we have a Bachelor of Arts degree programme in Chinese Studies alongside the Confucius institute in the university.鈥?
He, however, noted that the musical concert shows the integration between China and Nigeria as both countries have the same national holiday 鈥?October 1.

He added, 鈥淭his is to celebrate the co-operation that we are having with the Confucius institute and the degree programme in Chinese Studies, where we have over 50 students currently studying while some of them are already in China for the latter part of their education.

鈥淭he future of this collaboration is very bright because you can see that the influence of China in the world is very tremendous and quite a number of Chinese companies are here in Nigeria and are involved in numerous projects. And with our students, who now study Chinese, they will form the team that will be working with a lot of these Chinese companies and so we are preparing for the future.鈥?
The Chinese Director at the Confucius institute, University of Lagos, Wang Yongjing, said the concert was organised to help Nigerians understand more about Chinese culture.

According to him, 鈥淥ur students have always told us that they are very interested in the Chinese culture, hence this concert. So, we have brought artists from China, who use music and dance to educate the audience about the Chinese culture. While some of them are students from the Jiangxi Normal University, others are professionals in the field of music.鈥?
She noted that although this was the first time they were coming to Africa, she hoped that subsequent concerts would hold in the future.

Highlight of the concert was the presentation of China鈥檚 traditional musical instruments to the University of Lagos, which were featured at the concert. These were gratefully received by Prof. Oni, who promised that the school would put them into good use."
"Music Nigerian students thrill at Chinese Spring, Lantern Festival celebrations By Ijeoma Thomas-Odia Lovers of the Chinese culture, scholars and students of Chinese gathered recently and joined Chinese nationals in celebrating their country鈥檚 New Year.

Lovers of the Chinese culture, scholars and students of Chinese gathered recently and joined Chinese nationals in celebrating their country鈥檚 New Year. Known as the Spring Festival with the theme, 鈥楾he Year of the Rooster,鈥?the Chinese community, however, combined the celebration with its Lantern Festival, which falls on the 15th day of the lunar New Year.

The event was held at the Confucius institute, University of Lagos, Lagos, and it witnessed a large turnout of students from various primary and secondary schools across the state, including tertiary students studying Chinese.

There were presentation of songs, dance and playing of instruments all done in Chinese, which was majorly anchored by Chinese-speaking Nigerians. It also included games and competitions, which saw students going home with prizes.

Representing the Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos, Prof. Rahamon Bello, Director, Quality Assurance and SERVICOM Unit, Prof. Obinna Chukwu, said the Confucius institute is one of those collaborations the university has with Beijing Institute of Technology, which is set up for cultural exchanges, languages and extension of other exchanges between China and Nigeria.

鈥淭he Spring and Lantern festivals is an annual event through which our Confucius institute brings together people within the community, our younger children whom we have been interacting with through our Confucius institute, to showcase some of those cultures that exist in China, which we think will go a long way in instilling some sense of history in our younger generation and the guests present here today.鈥?
He said that with the changing economy and a lot of things happening between Nigeria and China, the event is quite significant one, adding, 鈥淓ven our Confucius institute extends hands to businessmen and women all over Lagos and beyond to teach them the Chinese language because language plays a huge role in communication, which will make doing business easier.鈥?
Chinese Consul-General in Lagos, Chao Xiaoliang, said the celebration of Chinese New Year and the Lantern Festival more Nigerian people get introduced to Chinese culture and they are learning the language, which will promote the relationship between China and Nigeria.

While the Director, Confucius institute, University of Lagos, Prof. Segun Awodusi, said being used to January 1 as New Year in Nigeria, the Chinese鈥檚 falls on January 26 or early February as the beginning of the Chinese New Year.

鈥淓very year also has its own thematic focus 鈥?鈥楾he Year of the Rooster鈥?鈥?and we are combining the Chinese New Year festival, which is known as the Spring Festival with the Lantern Festival, which normally takes place around February 11 every year.

鈥淭he China-Nigeria relationship is a fantastic one. Sometimes I feel it is divine. Will you believe that Nigeria鈥檚 Independence Day is October 1; the same with China and our president has also moved towards their direction to salvage the economy. So, there is a relationship in terms of infrastructural development and cultural co-operation.鈥?
While speaking on the sustenance of the event, Awodusi said, 鈥淲e have had this programme for eight years. The Confucius institute in UNILAG is nine years old and it has been on every year. We are jointly funded by the University and Hanban, the Confucius institute鈥檚 headquarters in China.

鈥淓very year in the last eight years, I can say that there is no time we don鈥檛 send at least 10 students to China. Some go on one year and others six months鈥?scholarships. Apart from that, we also organise children in high school, who are sent to China on summer. We are also making sure that we spread Chinese language to other tertiary institutions outside Lagos. We have sent some of the Chinese teachers to Ado-Ekiti to ensure that more students participate in the learning process.鈥?
"
"Prof. Joseph Ahaneku, the Vice Chancellor of the university, announced the scholarship at the send off ceremony of the awardees in Awka on Monday.

Ahaneku said the scholarship was part of the exchange between Confucius institute at Nnamdi Azikiwe University and Chinese Government.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the award was given under the auspices of the Institute to study Chinese programmes in different institutions in that country.

Ahaneku said that the Institute would continue to promote cultural and educational exchanges between China and Nigeria, as well as strengthen mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples.

""The main mission of Confucius institute at Nnamdi Azikiwe University is Chinese Language teaching and training in Nigeria, and provision of consultative services on Chinese culture and educational opportunities in China,鈥?he said.

According to him, the Institute exists only in Nnamdi Azikiwe University and University of Lagos but 鈥渄ue to our tireless efforts, a new one is being developed at Bayero University, Kano.

He charged the students to be diligent and be good ambassadors of the university while in China ranging for a period one and four years.

He said that three of the awardees were sponsored by the Chinese Government while the rest were sponsored by Institute.

"The Africa-China relations is about the historical, political, social, economic and cultural connections between the African continent and the world鈥檚 most populous country. It鈥檚 estimated that there are about 200,000 Africans working in China while one million Chinese citizens living in Africa. During the 1900s, the trade between China and Africa increased by 700 percent and, presently, China is Africa鈥檚 largest trading partner.

By 2006 the Sino-African trade jumped to $55 million, making China the second largest trading partner of Africa after the United States ($ 91 billion). In 2011, the trade between Africa and China was worth $166.3 billion, rising by a striking 33 percent, this included Chinese imports from Africa worth $93 billion. The imports were largely petroleum and agricultural products while Chinese exports to Africa were mainly manufactured products. There about 800 Chinese corporations doing business in Africa and most of them are private companies investing in energy, infrastructure, and the banking sector. One-third of China鈥檚 oil supplies comes mainly from Angola, while Burkina Faso, Mali, and Benin supply up to 20 percent of China鈥檚 cotton needs.

China also gave aid to newly independent African countries in the 1960s and 1970s, one of the notable early projects was the 1,860 km TAZARA Railway linking Zambia and Tanzania which was financed and built by China from 1970鈥?975. China was also giving more aid to African countries than the United States by 1978.

Africa plays host to Chinese cultural centres in Mauritius, Egypt, and Benin. For the promotion of Chinese language and culture, the Confucius institute has 20 centres distributed in 13 African countries. In light of the developments in relations between Africa and China, places in China tagged 鈥楥hocolate city鈥?and 鈥楲ittle Africa鈥?are growing with new immigrants, mostly Nigerians. Most of the African immigrants in China鈥揳n estimated 20,000鈥揳re concentrated in Guangzhou.

There have been some criticisms by the western countries against China, calling it a neocolonialist to Africa. It was accused of supplying Zimbabwe with arms, jet fighters, vehicles and other military equipment. But in 2007, China declared that it was limiting its assistance to humanitarian aid in Zimbabwe. China is Sudan鈥檚 largest economic partner , owning a 40 percent share of their oil production. But China was also criticised for its supportive relationship with the Sudanese government, which was accused of the mass killing in Darfur. Also, low-cost Chinese-made products put a strain on African markets with high competitive pressure on local businesses and cottage industries.

Despite the criticisms, there are some things that China understands about Africa that the West doesn鈥檛. China鈥檚 diplomatic ties with Africa has birthed partnerships for long-term business deals based on mutual benefits. Due to the tidal wave of investments from China and an increase in demand for commodities, the economic growth of African countries averaged 5.4 percent from 2000 to 2010, which had the continent ranked among the fastest growing regions of the world. In 2014, China signed infrastructure contracts worth over $70 billion for the continent and Chinese banks now provide more loans to African countries than the World Bank does.

The increasing challenges which can be linked with the dip in oil price, affecting oil producers such as Nigeria, Sudan, Angola have led to the diversification of economies for many countries in the region. The service and manufacturing sector in Africa increased from 44-48 percent and 17-23 percent respectively between 2010 and 2014, contributing to the continent鈥檚 growth.

China鈥檚 presence in Africa has initiated a paradigm shift, providing alternative options for the region other than the political interference of the Western countries."

The passing on and internment of the late Queen Elizabeth II, UK鈥檚 longest reigning monarch, is a historical event that will be marked for generations to come both at home and overseas. It should now be time for introspection for the country as it makes the transition to a new ruler.

However, to mark that it is back to business as usual, the UK government recently decided to resort to its most convenient scapegoat to place the blame for its changing fortunes. According to the title of a story published on September 18 in 鈥淭he Guardian鈥? 鈥淏eijing-backed Chinese language schools in UK to be replaced with teachers from Taiwan.鈥?According to the story, a cross-section of MPs in the country intend to replace Mandarin teachers in the world-renowned Confucius institutes in the country with Taiwan instructors.

Experts are questioning what has changed since 2014 when the then education minister Liz Truss, now prime minister, praised the network of Confucius classrooms, saying they 鈥渨ill put in place a strong infrastructure for Mandarin鈥?in the UK. It鈥檚 the Politics, Stupid! And by the look of things, Liz has been learning very fast.

It is rather obvious where the new UK PM is getting ideas from on the Confucius institute action. In a statement in August 2020, the then U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, claimed that the Confucius institute U.S. Center was 鈥渁n entity advancing Beijing鈥檚 global propaganda and malign influence campaign鈥?in American educational institutions. But as has now become customary with such sweeping statements, Pompeo did not offer any proof.

Consequently, the U.S. government changed the status of the Institutes in the country and re-designated their staff to diplomatic status. At the time 75 out of the 480 Confucius institutes globally were based in the U.S. Not much has been heard about the saga since then, but the point had been made on the way to go.

Well, the war against China cannot get lower than this; or can it? Education is a sector that has remained sacrosanct for eons, even as countries fight over other conflicts. No society can claim to have a monopoly of knowledge, say, the way economically it can claim to be a superpower. Every society has built on the foundations of others to advance its knowledge base from where others can take cue. This is basically the way major economies have built their research and development.

The West鈥檚 strategy is undoubtedly to weaken, cripple or completely destroy anything that is backed by or linked to the Chinese State, a stratagem already being applied in undermining Chinese technology companies, and the country鈥檚 participation in free trade. This is how Huawei Technologies has been fought in the West, and the U.S. continues with its trade war through punitive tariffs of Chinese goods.

Language is definitely a crucial part of geopolitics. It is the reason why Western culture has become perverse over the decades as the countries set up their language institutes around the world. On its website, UK鈥檚 British Council proudly states that it works with people in over 200 countries and territories and are on the ground in more than 100 countries. In 2021鈥?2 the Council reached 650 million people.

The U.S. carries out its outreach using Secretary of State departments including Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs and, Educational and Cultural Affairs which are embedded in the country鈥檚 embassies. According to the 2021 Global Diplomacy Index, the U.S. has the second most diplomatic missions globally after China, including 166 of the 193 member countries of the United Nations.

From the foregoing, one can only conclude that the West is envious of the increasing reach and acceptance of the Chinese language and culture, which is a crucial part of national branding. The more people learn and speak Mandarin overseas, the more they appreciate the Confucius philosophy and the Chinese way of life.

This is a development that is gradually eroding the West鈥檚 hegemony. The fact that the Confucius institutes have been targeted for crippling shows that they have been making inroads in people鈥檚 psyches, even in the West where established religion is constantly losing followers. The world鈥檚 serious crises cannot be addressed without a fresh philosophical approach, which incidentally China is offering.

Confucianism is a philosophy based on mutual respect and kindness toward others, and was developed to bring peace and stability in society. This is similar to China鈥檚 advocacy for a world with shared destiny where each country is a partaker of global wealth."

The Chinese films Farhiya Jibril watched on their home screens sparked her interest in learning Chinese. Her first film featured a character who frequently uttered the phrase 鈥淗谩i m茅iyu,鈥?which translates to 鈥淣ot Yet.鈥?She observed learning this word by heart, and it became the first word she learned in Chinese.

Jibril, born in Kenya to parents of two nationalities, her father, a Somalian, and her Ethiopian mother, later discovered that the Chinese also have fascinating cultures. One of them is their dancing, which she compares to Somali dances, and their typical attire.

So, when she finally wrote her Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams and scored 364 marks, gaining admission to State House Girls High School, she happily joined the school鈥檚 club for learning foreign languages. She took the language and began learning with the teacher in charge after discovering that the school also had the Chinese language.

鈥淚 want to join medicine field so I want to learn Chinese because they are good in medicine,鈥?says Jibril.

Currently, in Form Two Jibril has advanced to level three in her Chinese studies. Although she can understand more Chinese than she can speak or write, she says that her knowledge of the language has grown. The firstborn child in a family of six also trains her siblings to practice speaking when they are not in school. She says that because of the lessons, one of her sisters speaks Chinese as well.

鈥淚 grasp the Chinese words easily because they somehow repeat some of the words. If you compare lessons in level one and two, you鈥檒l see some words are related. In level one we focussed more on listening than writing,鈥?she says.

Even as students advance in their studies, the desire to learn Chinese grows. For example, Shantel Atieno, a 20-year-old University of Nairobi (UoN) student studying Quantity Surveying, realized this when she turned 18. It took the efforts of her younger sister to introduce her to Chinese films and songs, which sparked her interest in the language.

鈥淚 came to school one day and learned that they teach Chinese for free. I was so excited and I told my parents. Because I am also doing work in construction industry it also helps me when I learn Chinese because a number of the construction firms in Kenya right now are owned by Chinese,鈥?says Shantel, the second child in a family of five.

Shantel鈥檚 interest in learning foreign languages is not limited to Chinese. She also turned to Korean language, which she attributes to the Chinese films she enjoys watching, for fun.

State House Girls School has been facilitating its students to learn Chinese voluntarily for about four years now. According to Khakame Wamocha, the school鈥檚 Deputy Principal 鈥?Academics, having students who are fluent in the language will allow for intercultural communication and the elimination of communication barriers, particularly in the business world between China and Kenya.

鈥淚f a student has Chinese, I think they would have an upper hand compared to those ones who do not have. I think it is good that we expose our students to various languages to make them more marketable as they finish university,鈥?he told this publication.

According to Wamocha, over 50 State House Girls school students have enrolled in the Chinese language course. The subject, he says, is not examinable and lasts two hours on Saturday and Sunday when students attend classes at the University of Nairobi鈥檚 Confucius institute. He says that the school also teaches German and French, both of which are examinable.

According to Prof. Wang Shangxue, Director of the Confucius institute at the University of Nairobi, (CIUON) the ongoing online Chinese language exchange program is designed for Kenyan university and high school students. It attracts students from seven countries and many institutions. Currently, Kenya has about 90 students, the majority of whom are university students, with the remainder being high school students participating in the online exchange programme. All the participants have basic Chinese language background.

鈥淚t is very important for the students to open their mind and eyes to the globe outside Kenya. We introduced one of the provinces in China which has its own unique and exotic culture,鈥?she says.

Quoting the adage that it is better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books, Prof. Shangxue believes that all the students in the program love Chinese culture very much and are also interested in what is happening in China.

鈥淢odern technology has unlocked a lot of possibilities to do online programs. Because of COVID-19 some students cannot go to China to physically experience the culture. If they physically travel to China maybe they can only go to one destination and learn only one local culture,鈥?she said noting that the program involves Taiyuan Normal University students in China.

The online program is offered on weekends from 2-5 pm and Monday to Friday from 5pm to 7 pm. Prof. Shangxue says the institution will launch some other programs and incorporate more institutions in China and Kenya based on the students鈥?needs.

The Confucius institute was founded in 2005 as Africa鈥檚 first Confucius institute and has since been named Confucius institute of the Year seven times. The Confucius institute at UoN received the pioneer Confucius institute award in 2014. Its achievements further saw it named the Global Model Confucius institute in 2020.

Speaking last Thursday during this year鈥檚 official opening ceremony of the Chinese Film Festival, at the Kenya Cultural Centre. Prof. Stephene Kiama, vice chancellor UoN and Kenyan Director of the CIUON at the university, stated that since its inception, the institute has allowed close to 20,000 students to learn Chinese and has this year launched various programs for the students to experience their authentic multidimensional and panoramic view of China. He described Chinese Festival movies as an appealing social art form that is used to entertain, educate, and explore important social issues.

鈥淔ilms have the power to make us learn about new culture, experience a different perspective or open our eyes to a world we know nothing about,鈥?said Prof. Kiama.

"For more than one year now, the Covid-19 global pandemic has thrust China squarely into the international limelight.

Ever since discovery of the novel coronavirus in the Far East country, the Chinese government has pulled all stops, both at home and abroad, to help in combating the pandemic.

Interestingly, the annual United Nations Chinese Language Day, which was celebrated on April 20, has come at a time when the world is analysing China鈥檚 success in tackling Covid-19.

The world is fast learning a new way of doing things as it watches China鈥檚 best management practices in the ongoing crisis.

The UN Chinese Language Day is marked through a series of painting exhibitions, learning forums, special lectures, and fashion shows aimed at exposing ancient Chinese culture to the world.

The main aspects of Chinese culture include architecture, medicine, music, literature, cuisine, visual arts, philosophy, and religion. The theme for this year's event is ""Spring.""

The occasion is celebrated alongside the annual UN Language Day, which commemorates the use of multiple languages and cultural diversity of the six official languages in the UN - Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic.

Chinese was established as an official language of the UN in 1946. Among the other languages, it is the most widely spoken by a single country, an estimated 1.4 billion people.

In 2009, the UN Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization included the three millennia old Chinese calligraphy in the 鈥淚ntangible Cultural Heritage List.鈥?
As China鈥檚 economy, infrastructural, and technological genius constantly grows and reaches all corners of the earth, there is a corresponding awareness of the pervasive and unique Chinese culture.

The increasing acceptance of Chinese culture and ideology globally has been made possible by mutual understanding, rather than through assimilation and replacement applied by some hegemonic cultures."
"The construction of the Standard Gauge Railway from Mombasa to Nairobi is ahead of schedule, the Chinese Government has said.

Chinese envoy to Kenya Dr Liu Xianfa said on Monday that 50 per cent of the construction work of bridges, culverts and sub-grade has been completed.

He added that the design of the electric power to be used in the railway, among other crucial work, is also complete. Groundbreaking for the project was done in November 2013 by President Uhuru Kenyatta.

""Ever since the start of the construction, the SGR project has achieved significant and vigorous progress,"" he told workers and dignitaries in Section 9 campsite of the project at Syokimau, just outside Nairobi.

He added, ""Currently over 2,000 Chinese and 25,000 Kenyan workers are proceeding with the project.""

The Syokimau campsite handles the design and construction of the infrastructure that will handle electric power transmission that will be used by the locomotives. Once complete, the campsite will be the command center of the SGR operation system.

The envoy said that the SGR project has recently established a talent training base that is expected to train more than 15,000 skilled workers as well as 400 engineers and advanced technicians. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet (left) and Chinese Ambassador Liu Xianfa (left) join in the grand finale dance during the Standard Gauge Railway/China-Kenya Cultural Exchange performances at Syokimau Railway Station on Monday.

He also announced plans to set up a railway academy to train key Kenyan staff in railway construction, operation and maintenance even after the Chinese are gone.

""Currently, 94 per cent of casual labourers in the SGR project are Kenyans while 64 per cent of skilled workers are also Kenyans. Besides a great deal of construction material like cement and commodities have been purchased locally,"" he said.

He was speaking during a programme to entertain the SGR workers organised by Confucious Institute of the University of Nairobi which teaches Chinese language and culture to Kenyans.

On his part, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said the security agencies are keen to ensure maximum security for the SGR workers to ensure that they conduct their work without any hitches.

""This is a vital project that will enhance the prosperity and development of our country and the entire region. We will do our best to ensure it proceeds without interruption. This project will cement the ties of friendship between Kenya and China,"" he said.

During the ceremony, the students and teachers of the Confucius institute presented an assortment of Chinese songs and dances for the guests."

Kenyatta University鈥檚 Department of Fine Art and Design finally got an art gallery of its own.

Having gotten by without a permanent gallery since the mid-1960s when the art department was initially set up, it鈥檚 been regularly exhibiting students鈥?artwork, according to Department Chair Adonijah Ombura, only that the works have been hung in various venues, from the Students鈥?Business Centre to assorted classrooms.

But since 2018, when the International Language and Culture Centre (ILCC) was constructed, thanks to support from the Chinese Confucius institute, the Art Department finally got the spacious venue it had wished for.

鈥淎nne Mwiti is in charge of the gallery,鈥?says Mr Ombura, who adds that space will be available to both KU students and faculty as well as the public.

The current exhibition, based on works by masters鈥?degree candidates, just opened early this month and runs to the end of June.

Both Rupante Tobiko and Patrick Esenerna have done rigorous research to develop the mammoth exhibitions they have put on display. One aims to document his people鈥檚 pre-colonial culture using a variety of techniques; the other examines the environmental problem of trash and its potential for being transformed into splendid treasures.

Tobiko鈥檚 exhibition was such a rich, multifaceted assortment of both the form and content of a singular theme that I spent my whole morning with him.

Developing a genre of painting that he calls 鈥榮moke art鈥? he says he grew up playing not with fire but with smoke.

鈥淚 used to experiment with smoke as a child since I grew up without electricity, only [kerosene-lit] flames,鈥?says Tobiko, who was born and brought up by parents who never went to school.

鈥淏ut my father valued the education he never had and sent all seven of his children to school, selling cattle for school fees,鈥?says the artist whose exhibition constitutes not only his final project before earning a Master鈥檚 of Fine Art. It鈥檚 also the first step in his broader goal of documenting the entirety of Maasai culture.

Growing up in a manyatta and attending most of the traditional ceremonies that moran typically does, Tobiko says he is comfortable living as a man of two worlds. Nonetheless, his exhibition is focused on his people and features smoke paintings, sketches, video, and a catalogue inspired by images of all things Maasai.

But as interesting as are his portraits of Maasai moran decked out in lion manes, ostrich feathers, and brass earrings, what is truly intriguing about his exhibition is his smoke art.

鈥淚 conducted 672 experiments working with smoke on various surfaces to see which ones worked best,鈥?he says, pointing at parts of his video that illustrate that research.鈥?
鈥淚 found that smoke works best on surfaces that are smooth and porous,鈥?he explains.

鈥淚 experimented with everything from paper and cardboard to aluminium foil, canvas, and glass,鈥?he adds.

His exhibition only has one aluminium-backed painting and one smoke-painted glass. The rest were a mix of smoke on either paper, cardboard or canvas. But he used multiple techniques to create his portraits, including paper-cuts and stencils, as well as painting using a flame almost as if it were a brush to create dark, smoky effects.

Tobiko uses a fixer (or varnish) to ensure his smoke art didn鈥檛 get rubbed or smudged.

鈥淚 left one painting half-fixed so the examiners could see the difference,鈥?he says, touching an unfixed part of that painting to prove how delicate the technique is. His fingertip was covered in smoke.

All of Tobiko鈥檚 paintings are beautifully mounted, framed, and captioned with relevant details. Nonetheless, he had to explain one moran head-dress made with dead birds (stuffed with grass) having beautiful plumes.

鈥淭hey were practising early forms of taxidermy,鈥?he says.

Taking pride in being a Maasai, Tobiko has felt no conflict about having a Western education but still being deeply rooted in traditional culture.

鈥淚鈥檓 committed to documenting as much Maasai culture as I can,鈥?he says."

Economists agree that China has made a spectacular rise from a very poor nation in 1949 to very rich one in 2019. Chinese banks are among the largest cross border lenders in Asia, said Economist in 2019. Seven of the top 20 equity underwriters in Asia In 2018 were Chinese. Warren Buffet鈥檚 Berkshire Hathaway had invested USD 232 million in BYD, a Chinese energy products company, in 2008. In 2019, China had the world鈥檚 largest high-speed rail network of 29,000 kilometers. This is about two thirds of the world鈥檚 total high-speed rail network.

China is now due to become the biggest economy in the world, ousting the US from that position, analysts said in 2019. In 2020, China had become the world鈥檚 largest economy in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). China鈥檚 economy had reached a stunning 25.4 trillion USD in 2020, said analysts. By 2030 China will be the leading economy. By 2030 China will also have the largest navy and the most powerful aircraft carrier, they said.

China鈥檚 Belt and Road Initiative is a massive global network of ports, railways, roads and industrial parks spanning Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe, with trillions invested in new infrastructure. China鈥檚 B&R is supported by a bank, unlike other similar ventures. Sri Lanka is a member.

More countries are joining it. Iraq announced in September 2019 that Iraq will join China鈥檚 鈥淏elt and Road鈥?project. Iraq is grateful to China for its valuable support and is willing to work together in the 鈥極ne Belt, One Road鈥?framework,鈥?said the Prime Minister of Iraq during a state visit to China. Beijing is Baghdad鈥檚 biggest trade partner, while Iraq is China鈥檚 second biggest oil supplier.

This November (2020) China and 14 other Asia-Pacific countries signed the world鈥檚 largest trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. (RCEP). China has joined forces with more than a dozen countries across the Asia Pacific region to sign a huge free trade deal nearly a decade in the making, said analysts.

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership spans 15 countries and 2.2 billion people, or nearly 30% of the world鈥檚 population. Their combined GDP totals roughly $26 trillion and they account for nearly 28% of global trade based on 2019 data. The deal includes several of the region鈥檚 richest countries, China, Japan, South Korea. It also includes New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.

The trade agreement was first proposed in 2012 as a way to create one of the world鈥檚 largest free-trade zones. Tariffs and quotas would be eliminated on 65% of the goods that are traded in the region. The economic benefits are modest and would take years to materialize but this was a coup for China, said Citi Research analysts.

The Communist Party intends to keep a firm grip on its capitalist economy. Keeping big business in check is part of that plan, said analysts. There was a crackdown on global spending. Anbang Insurance was nationalised, putting the Waldorf under the ownership of China鈥檚 Ministry of Finance. Baoshang was taken over by the state. Acquisitions of European football clubs by Chinese groups came to an end. HNA, an airlines and logistics group that bought a large stake in Deutsche Bank and Hilton Worldwide, faced difficulties. . (Economist)

China鈥檚 overextended financial conglomerates and China鈥檚 tech billionaires were brought to heel. Six of China鈥檚 20 most valuable listed companies are tech firms with billions of users. In addition, firms were asked to launch Party committees that will oversee corporate decisions. Also set up monitoring units that would allow the Party to audit company managers. (Economist)

The Republic of China celebrated its 70th anniversary with a very impressive, very long parade which included an 鈥榓wesome display鈥?of military equipment. In the military parade in 1949, only 70 planes could be found so they had been ordered to fly past twice. In 2019 there were 160 aircraft and 580 pieces of military equipment on display. China has developed military abilities that can reach potential adversaries across the globe, said experts.

The military parade was broadcast live, so everybody now knows that the China has invented powerful new weapons. China has no recent experience in sea or air battles, observed critics, but they are developing

[effective]

missiles and asymmetric systems.

The military parade showed off China鈥檚 most advanced weapons, some being shown for the first time. They included the following. The J-20 supersonic stealth fighters, the H-6N with an aerial refueling probe added, that could be used to deter US aircraft carriers venturing into the South China Sea and the DF-26 ballistic missile which, fired from land bases, is believed to have the accuracy to strike at US Navy鈥檚 aircraft carriers.

Also on display was the DR-8 or WZ-8 supersonic drone, a reconnaissance drone that that could potentially be deployed by aircraft, to infiltrate enemy airspace and gather intelligenceincluding determining the damage done by China鈥檚 missiles. It could be used to spot distant targets on very short notice and hit them with a conventional ballistic strike.

The Dong Feng 41, or DF-41, is an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 15,000 kilometers, allowing it to reach anywhere in the United States in about 30 minutes. It is capable of hurling multiple nuclear warheads all over the United States, said experts.鈥?It could be moved around by road and fired quickly.

Its range of up to 15,000 kilometers would make it the world鈥檚 longest-range military missile. Some analysts say it can travel up to 25 times the speed of sound. It could carry as many as 10 independent warheads, which can hit 10 different targets over a wide area.鈥?
One of the most closely-watched weapons was the Dongfeng-17, a new hypersonic ballistic nuclear missile believed capable of breaching all existing anti-missile shields deployed by the U.S. and its allies. Experts say it can breach any defence system. The DF-17 missile is thought to be able to travel at more than five times the speed of sound. It鈥檚 designed to bypass enemy missile defense systems by traveling at speeds more than 3,400 miles per hour at low altitudes.

DF-17 is a nuclear-capable glider that is designed to maneuver at high speed to evade anti-missile defenses. The glider is believed to be able to carry conventional and nuclear devices. The emergence of such a system would have a considerable impact, highlighting China鈥檚 progress in designing hypersonic non-strategic gliders, a segment in which Russians and Americans are lagging behind, said experts.鈥?
China kept up its contact with Sri Lanka during the USA-controlled Yahapalana rule of 2015-2019. Tianjin Symphony orchestra played at Nelum Pokuna in 2017, to a full audience. Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Beijing Chamber of International Commerce signed an MOU to promote trade and commerce between the two countries in 2015.

In 2014 Beijing Foreign Students University signed two memoranda with University of Colombo to set up a China Sri Lanka study Centre and a Confucius institute. China said that there is a high demand for Sinhala degree courses at the Beijing Foreign Students University, due to the increase of Chinese investments and business groups. The university has facilities for PhD programs in Sinhala too. Chinese international broadcasting service had a Sinhala channel, they added.

China did not relax once Pohottu came to power. China remained watchful. Two criticisms of Port City were made. China replied. CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd wishes to draw your attention regarding, a misleading reference about Port City Colombo, in an article, titled 鈥楧id Expert Committee use similar standards in evaluating MCC and Port City loans鈥? by Harim Peiris, published on 09/07/2020, and subsequently another opinion article titled 鈥楽aving nation from Chinese loan strategies鈥?by G.A.D Sirimal, on 11/07/2020.

Both articles say 鈥渢he issue that arises is whether the SLPP and its experts use the same criteria and standards when evaluating the MCC grant with Port City loans and project.鈥?Port City Colombo is not a Chinese loan. Port City Colombo is purely a commercial trade agreement and a 100% direct investment.

After the Eelam victory of 2009, Mahinda Rajapaksa wished to embark on a development progamme. The only country that came forward to invest in Sri Lankan infrastructure in a big way was China. Therefore, it wasn鈥檛 a foreign policy shift but an economic necessity, said Colombage. West had boycotted us on the grounds of human rights violations. So China filled the vacuum.

China became the biggest foreign investor in Sri Lanka, dwarfing foreign inflows from other countries by a significant margin. According to a March 2020 study by the London-based Chatham House think tank, Chinese infrastructure investment in Sri Lanka amounted to $12.1 billion between 2006 and July 2019. Beijing is the largest foreign source of investment in Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Maldives, according to a 2018 study by Mumbai-based Gateway House think tank. Although the US is Sri Lanka鈥檚 biggest export market and a major development partner, it has been unable to match the Chinese economic might.

Since the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the President last year, the government has once again deepened its relationship with China. We have always had excellent relations with China, said President Gotabaya. Sri Lanka relations with China is mainly economic, he observed.

China has offered to help mitigate the financial crisis faced by Sri Lanka. Pohottu asked for a $700 million loan. China gave US$500 million on a 10-year concessionary loan. China also provided generous support towards controlling Covid-19.

Pohottu has bluntly pointed out to its pro-US, anti-China critics that it is China that has the most amount of cash now鈥? In different times in world history, different countries have had the most amount of cash. And now it happens to be China, Pohottu explained. However, Sri Lanka is exploring different options to repay its debt, in addition to loans from China, currency swap facilities with India and China, and Samurai and Panda bonds, Pohottu added.

Despite the fact that Chinese loans to Sri Lanka remain below 10 percent of our overall debt burden, and those loans are concessionary loans with an interest rate around two percent, Pompeo and other US officials have tried to portray that China has Sri Lanka in a 鈥榙ebt trap鈥? complained Pohottu.

Pohottu dismissed the accusation that China is setting up 鈥渄ebt traps鈥?in developing countries. China is Sri Lanka鈥檚 largest creditor but Sri Lanka is not caught in a China debt trap. 90 percent of Sri Lanka鈥檚 debt is in fact owed to western and multilateral financial institutions, Pohottu said.

This statement has received support from abroad. Min Ye, Professor of International relations at Boston University has stated that studies conducted by scholars and researchers at US-based institutions have disproved the charge of a debt entrapment policy by China, whether it refers to Sri Lanka or Pakistan, or elsewhere.

China鈥檚 support was to enable Sri Lanka to pay off debt to other lenders. This could leave Sri Lanka completely in the hands of China, said . Mick Moore. At any moment, China could decide not to extend further loans to Sri Lanka. On the other hand China could agree to give very large, low cost loans to enable the government to pay its debt to other lenders, he added.

Epithets like Trojan Horse鈥?and Greeks bearing gifts鈥?have been used to refer to offers of assistance by China to Sri Lanka. Pohottu has ignored these warnings鈥? Analysts observe that Pohottu has pulled the plug on a light rail transit system that was to be financed and constructed by Japan. It is believed that the construction of the project will now be handed over to a Chinese company. (Continued)"

The University of Nairobi (UoN) has distanced its self from a video clip that shows one of its lecturers protesting for being barred from using a lecture hall at the Confucius institute.

In the clip, Dr Richard Bosire can be seen asking some of the students why the UoN has allowed the Chinese to grab the institute.

鈥淲hat we are protesting is the Chinese locking students out of the facility with their lecturer. We cannot allow it!鈥?Bosire can be heard.

He then wonders if they want them to learn under trees. 鈥淚s it Chinese colonialism? They have gone too far,鈥?charged Dr Bosire.

Dr Bosire, who is also the Universities Academic Staff Union UoN chapter chairman, was protesting after the Chinese allegedly locked students from accessing a lecture room at the University Towers.

Not a property of the People鈥檚 Republic of China

But according to the Director, Corporate Affairs of UoN John Korir, the Confucius institute at the University of Nairobi is not a property of the People鈥檚 Republic of China.

鈥淭he attached video by Dr Bosire is misleading and ill-intentioned,鈥?said Korir. 鈥淗is sentiments are personal and do not reflect the correct position. This class had been assigned a different lecture hall.鈥?
According to Dr Bosire, the Chinese claim they bought two floors in the tower. 鈥淭he university has given them land, they constructed a huge facility, perhaps on two acres of land, yet they are closing us out,鈥?Bosire alleged.鈥?
Confucius institute is passed off as an education organisation with a mission of helping the people in the world to learn the Chinese language and the culture of China.

Confucius institute at the University of Nairobi was launched as the first of its kind in Africa in 2005 by then Chinese president Hu Jintao."
"But the Director of Corporate Affairs John Orindi said that is not the stand of UoN.

鈥淭he Confucius institute at the University of Nairobi is not a property of the People's Republic of China. The attached video by Dr Bosire is misleading and ill-intentioned,鈥?Orindi said on Twitter.

""His sentiments are personal and do not reflect the correct position. This class had been assigned a different lecture hall.""

Upon reaching the University, officials told the Star that not all students were prevented from accessing lecture halls at the seventh floor.

鈥淭he students vandalised the posters and the Chinese decorations on the walls. So out of fear that they could do more damage, a decision was made to lock out this particular group of students from accessing the classrooms,鈥?the official, who did not want to be identified, said.

The 22-floor UoN towers, unveiled in 2017, is one of the tallest buildings located and owned by a university in the country.

It houses a lecture hall with a capacity for 500 people and four 300-seater lecture theatres in addition to numerous 60-seater lecture halls.

Part of the rationale for its construction was to overcome a shortage in lecture halls, which had in the past compelled the institution to shift some classes to external buildings."
"""We fell in love but it was very difficult at first,"" Xu Jing explains from the courtyard of the Fairmont Hotel in Nairobi.

""My family didn't know much about Africa at all. They hadn't even seen a Kenyan before so they were very worried.""

Henry Rotich - the Kenyan in question - was just as concerned.

The pair had fallen for each other after Rotich was sent to China to learn Mandarin as part of his government job.

It took him many weeks to get his language skills good enough to meet Jing's father over a nerve-filled lunch, at which he asked for his blessing.

""Her father didn't say much so I was really worried about what he was thinking, whether or not he even liked the food we were serving him,"" Rotich recalls.

Apparently his mastery of Mandarin was enough: a decade later, the couple are living in the Kenyan capital, proud parents to two children.

Jing now teaches Mandarin at the Confucius institute based at the University of Nairobi, one of an estimated 10,000 Chinese nationals who have moved to the East African state.

Their family provides one snapshot of the growing links between Chinese and Kenyans - propelled somewhat by China's massive investment in the country.

It is a pattern seen across the continent. Back in 2000, China-Africa trade amounted to $10 billion (拢7 billion). That figure is now believed to have crossed the $300 billion mark.

RUMOURS

Jing and Rotich's story is a success, but the relationship between the two doesn't always go so smoothly.

Along Thika Road, a major new Chinese-built superhighway linking Nairobi to the industrial town of Thika, rumours of so-called ""Thika babies"" abound.

According to the whispers, Chinese construction workers have fathered hundreds of babies with local women, before disappearing into the ether.

Media outlets even reported the story of a schoolgirl, pregnant with a worker's baby, who was unable to identify him among the hundreds of other construction workers.

But for all the hysteria - there is even a song dedicated to the phenomenon - most Kenyans say they have never seen evidence of such children.

But that doesn't stop some believing the rumours.

""I would say I've seen around 20鈥?It's very hush-hush as many of the Chinese fathers didn't stick around,"" Thatcher, a Kenyan-Chinese translator who lives close to the Thika Road, tells us.

""I think in 15 or 20 years' time, when these children are all grown up and going to colleges, then we will know the true scale of it.""

'AFRICAN TIME IS CHANGING'

Disappearing fathers are not a problem in most Chinese-Kenyan homes, of course.

For Jing - who grew up during China's one-child policy - it is sometimes the sheer abundance of family members that can be somewhat overwhelming.

""We are used to having big extended family and lots of big families coming to spend time with one another a lot,"" Rotich says. ""We're used to having say our nieces or nephews coming to stay with us for long periods of time.

""In China they don't have that as much. Family may visit but for a shorter time and I don't think that closeness with the extended family is the same.""

And there are other cultural difference, such as over attitudes to time.

Jinhua Lu, a consultant advising Chinese companies how to best operate in Kenya, says there are still barriers.

""I hate to generalise but there is a notion that Kenyans take things more slowly,"" he says. ""They like to enjoy life and have a sense of community that the Chinese don't have.

""The Chinese come here and just have the end goal in mind. They work long hours - they take very few breaks and will even work over weekends just to get the project done as quickly as possible.""

It is something Jing and Rotich recognise.

""Yes it's true Kenyans can be more relaxed about these things but Kenyans are changing鈥?this concept of African time is changing. The pace of development is progressing well and people have many things to do - so we have many things to do in our time.""

And anyway, the civil servant adds, he has learnt to be on time: ""Xu makes sure of it.""

And with more Chinese than ever before arriving in Kenya, larger efforts are being made to overcome the cultural gap.

The Confucius institute - where Jing works - is one of the Chinese government-funded programmes which they hope will help smooth relations between Chinese and Kenyans.

For the Kenyans who study here, the hope is that they will go on to get well-paid jobs in Chinese companies. For the Chinese, this is a strong statement that the country plans to have strong ties with Kenya for the long run.

But the sight of a Chinese mother at the schoolgates still creates a bit of a stir.

""All the other mothers want to speak with Xu and all the children jump up and down and say: 'It's the Chinese mummy!'"" Rotich says with a broad grin.

""Our children look like ordinary Kenyans so when I go out with them, people ask what language is that they're speaking?

""When I say: 'Chinese', they say鈥?'What?! They can speak Chinese!' They get so excited and everyone wants to ask us questions and become our friends.""

As for Jing, she sees Kenya as her future.

""I do miss China but Kenya is my home now,"" she says. ""Many of the Chinese who come here love this country and I think many of them will be here for a long time to come,"" she concludes."

The Chinese government on Thursday officially handed over a modern international culture and language centre worth over Sh1.09 billion to the Kenyatta University.

The building hosting a Confucius institute, an Africa Education Institute, an International Languages Centre and a culture centre will be used towards promotion of local, African and foreign languages, arts and culture.

Its construction began in 2016 and was completed in February last year.

Speaking on behalf of the Chinese ambassador to Kenya during the handing over ceremony at the main campus on Thursday, Mr Li Xuhang, the officer in charge of affairs at the Chinese Embasy, said the four-winged building financed by the Chinese government through a grant competitively won by KU, is a mark of increased collaborations between Kenya and China in the education sector.

鈥淥ther than this building, the Chinese government through the China Exim bank facilitated the setting up of the state-of-the-art Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital that is now completed,鈥?said Mr Xuhan.

EQUIP FACILITY

The hospital was built at a cost of Sh11 billion, much of which went into equipping the facility with modern diagnostics equipment.

The handing over ceremony was attended by top officials from the National Treasury, Ministry of Education and Kenyatta University chairman of the council prof. Shem Migot.

Treasury Secretary Henry Rotich noted that the country鈥檚 key bilateral linkages with the People鈥檚 Republic of China have resulted in a number of benefits, especially in bridging infrastructural gaps.

鈥淭his has not been an easy path given the various global challenges associated with international financing for infrastructural projects. However our partners have and continue to stand with us in our efforts to modernise our national infrastructure across various sectors,鈥?said Mr Rotich in a speech read on his behalf by Treasury鈥檚 director for resource allocation, Jackson Kinyanjui.

Education Secretary Amina Mohamed noted that the handing over ceremony was timely due to the ongoing efforts by her ministry to promote delivery of quality education and align the country鈥檚 education with the global trends."
"To catch a peek into China鈥檚 permeation in Kenya, you need a chance at Kilimani, a leafy Nairobi suburb. Chinese scripted business signage jostle for space with those in English or Swahili.

Change is here. There is a linguistic fad sweeping the continent and the world. Kenya is now entrenching Mandarin in the school system. Many other African states like Uganda, South Africa and Tanzania are also scrambling to teach the language. It is a statement and recognition that China has arrived as a global power.

IDEOLOGIES

Pragmatism ordains that since China is a rising power 鈥?will be the largest economy by 2020 according to Standard Chartered Bank PLC 鈥?proficiency in Mandarin, proponents reason, strategically prepares future generations for bountiful opportunities.

True. But that is where romanticism ends and real politics begins. ""Language"", wrote Bishop Antonio de Nebrija, in Castilian Grammar, ""has always been the perfect instrument of empire."" It is a tool of soft power buttressing the hard power of economics and military might.

Indeed, the dynamics of language in the international system are nuanced and complex. Language is an apparatus of power and prestige. It constructs and transmits ideologies. It vends culture and generates attraction. It manipulates and persuades. And, no matter sophistication in tanks, dominant powers desire to have their languages on the tongues of everyone.

That is why pro-Mandarin policies are a fantastic gift to China. Their symbolism is priceless as they procure psychological legitimacy for the red dragon. It is recognition from states, an acknowledgment of China鈥檚 primacy in the global political spectrum.

Currently, English is the king of dialects ruling over the world of diplomacy, commerce, technology, internet and entertainment. This is for a reason. During its golden age, the British Empire bestrode and controlled 25 per cent of the world, and spread English in the imperialistic expeditions.

English merchandised England鈥檚 values and culture. It altered national consciousness of colonies. Britain secured consent from the colonies to be ruled over in a phenomenon, which the Italian philosopher, Antonio Gramci, in his Prison Notebooks, described as ""cultural hegemony"".

PROPAGANDA

Indeed, in The Post American World and the Rise of the Rest, Mr Fareed Zakaria observes: ""Britain鈥檚 stories and characters became more securely a part of the international culture than any other nation 鈥?So too did many English values.""

Britain still draws cultural and commercial dividends from the spread of English. The rise of the US as a superpower ensured English reigned supreme. It became the ""ultimate instrument of the empire"" as the US used it to consolidate its place in the hearts and minds of the world.

Indeed, today, English is to languages what the greenback is to currency. And now, Mandarin hankers to claim this place just as the yuan yearns to dislodge the dollar.

To understand the dynamics and politics of language you need a sojourn back in time 鈥?1976 Soweto, South Africa. Pupils rose against the iron fisted apartheid regime. The iconic uprising was in protest against the introduction of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction. Pupils feared they would be manipulated and controlled by the language of the oppressor who would use it for ideological engineering. They preferred English. The Soweto Massacre, historians content, emboldened the struggle to dismantle apartheid.

That is why, when Mandarin joins our linguistic mix, you can be sure it will also transmit the Chinese value system and rework our consciousness. It will be a tool of propaganda in public diplomacy clandestinely embedded in narratives exalting the Chinese way of life and thought.

Yet, Mandarin seems unstoppable. In October 2018, Zambians woke up to a shocker. The Times of Zambia, a state-owned paper, had published the main story in Mandarin to much consternation of the public and opposition politicians.

Whilst the paper blithely defended use of Mandarin as a strategy to increase revenue, it was not lost to observers that Zambia is cripplingly indebted to China and the article was a scheme to normalise the Chinese into the public psyche.

Small wonder Kenya鈥檚 prolific novelist, Prof Ngugi wa Thiong鈥檕, abhorred imperial language. In his Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature, Ngugi observes ""the language of power is English and that becomes internalised 鈥?you normalise the abnormal and the absurdities of colonialism, and turn them into a norm from which you operate. Then you don鈥檛 even think about it.""

DOMINATION

Indeed, the clout of language, beyond the functional, has for long intrigued scholars. The proclivity of language for domination is a tool profitably utilised in politics by ruling cultures.

The ideological constructs of language subtly overrun the subconscious, and even redesign identity regularised as normal. Philosopher Pierre Bourdieu, in Language and Symbolic Power, links languages to hegemonic enterprises and even in the diffusion of dominant ideas, persuasions that Ngugi holds.

Since in the international system a state鈥檚 interest supersedes everything, deploying language and culture to win over the hearts and minds is critical as Bishop Nebrija noted in 1492.

It is neither lost to the Communist Party of China nor any other power how language is critical in manoeuvring the dicey international systems and geopolitics. That is why for the past 14 years, the Chinese established a juggernaut 鈥?the Confucius institute 鈥?to spread Mandarin and other cultural ideals. Today, the well-oiled machinery has operations in at least 170 countries. Through its charm offensive, 67 countries worldwide have sanctioned laws and policies to teach Mandarin and Chinese culture.

And that is why for China, the Confucius institutes are strewn across the globe numbering 500. The target was 1,000 by 2020. Africa is home to 54; first hosted at the University of Nairobi. Today, Kenya has four institutes and South Africa five. These two are trophy anchor countries serving as gateway to Africa for many powers.

This is a premeditated scheme. In 2007 at the 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the then Chinese President, Hu Jintao, knew a robust culture was critical to the rising China. ""The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will definitely be accompanied by the thriving of Chinese culture,"" he declared.

Language is at the heart of such renaissance. That is why in 2014, President Xi Jinping was bullish and committed to ""increase China鈥檚 soft power, give a good Chinese narrative, and better communicate China鈥檚 message to the world.""

Indeed, soft power is a pearl that China needs in its meteoric rise. Currently China鈥檚 power is single-dimensional 鈥?economic. To be a true power, the capability to influence, without coercion, is indispensable.

MANIPULATION

The world鈥檚 lingua franca, English, is venerated back in the UK as a producer of ""attractiveness"". In a report, The English Effect: The Impact of English, what it is worth to the UK and why it matters to world, the British Council, Britain鈥檚 cultural apparatus, observes 鈥渢he global power of English has helped the UK to grow and maintain its position as a cultural superpower 鈥?with every chance of continuing to grow its soft power influence in today鈥檚 highly networked world鈥?

That is why it is still a paradox of sorts. In China folks are changing their first names to western sounding ones like Smith, Joshua or Kevin.

Millions others are studying English, including taking mass classes in stadiums. While the rich fancy western education and cultural products.

That is how sexy English is. In fact, the dominance of English is even unsettling folks in Brussels and more so the French. It has triggered some sort of race for the tongues.

Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron, rolled out an ambitious strategy to make French the dominant language in Africa, online and displace English in Brussels.

While addressing students in Burkina Faso, he warned ""to refuse the French language in order to make English fashionable on the African continent is to be blind to the future 鈥? a future he reckoned will be dominated by French in Africa and globally. He described French as the language of emancipation."

Benjamin Bataringaya sat in the corner of an empty classroom, reading from a Chinese language textbook and then rewriting the characters in his exercise book.

For close to two years now, this has been his way of practicing and mastering how to read and write Chinese Mandarin.

鈥淯nlike English which uses alphabets, in Mandarin, you have to learn and get the characters and tones right. This is what makes it a difficult language to learn in the beginning,鈥?says Bataringaya, 21, a student major in organisational studies at Makerere University, who is taking Chinese language as a minor subject.

With daily practice, Mr Bataringaya says he now feels more confident speaking Mandarin with his teachers and classmates.

Recently, he also emerged the Uganda winner of the Chinese Bridge, an international culture and language proficiency programme for students from various institutions worldwide.

鈥淚 see a lot of opportunities as a Ugandan who can speak Chinese. I will become internationally marketable since Chinese businesses are expanding in Africa and beyond,鈥?Mr Bataringaya tells The EastAfrican.

鈥淭hey will need people who can speak the language to be a bridge between China and the rest of the world,鈥?he adds.

Bataringaya is learning Mandarin from the Confucius institute hosted at Makerere, Uganda鈥檚 oldest university.

Started in Uganda in 2014, it is one of over 50 Confucius institutes spread across Africa, to teach and expose Chinese language and culture to the rest of the world.

The institutes, which are funded by the Chinese government through its Ministry of Education, known as Hanban, offer language classes to interested students enrolled in the host university鈥檚 various programmes but also to those outside of the university who are keen to learn Chinese.

鈥淲ith 1.3 billion people and growing, China will soon be an economic superpower and those who can speak Chinese will benefit from this newfound status,鈥?said Brenda Kunihira, a graduate of the Confucius institute at Makerere University.

Ms Kunihira currently works as an interpreter and translator for a Chinese construction firm where she earns $300 in monthly salary 鈥?much higher than the average pay for an entry-level graduate job in Uganda.

On a continent where jobs are hard to come by, especially for young people, she says being able to speak and write Chinese opened doors for her.

Skills mismatch

鈥淓ven before I graduated, Chinese firms and business people were already hiring me to interpret for and translate legal documents and other business paper work. I also go to their meetings and help them translate things. Many of my colleagues who did not study Chinese have not found jobs yet,鈥?Ms Kunihira boasts.

A 2016 report by the African Development Bank titled, Jobs for Youth in Africa found that of nearly 420 million youth aged 15 to 35, one-third are unemployed and discouraged, while another one-third are employed vulnerably because of skills mismatch with labour market requirements.

Ms Kunihira鈥檚 dream is to go to China and study for an advanced language course and become more marketable in the future job market.

Over the past two decades, China鈥檚 presence in Africa has been growing, with estimates from the China Global Investment Tracker, published by the American Enterprise Institute showing that between 2005 and 2018, Chinese investments and contracts in sub-Saharan Africa totalled $299 billion.

The majority of the investments are in the energy, transport and metals sectors.

But beyond the investments already being undertaken or underway, the Chinese government has made more financial promises to Africa.

During the 2018 Forum on China-Africa Co-operation held in Beijing, President Xi Jinping announced that China would provide an additional $60 million in financial support to the continent.

With many young Africans eager to benefit from these investments and improve their economic and job prospects, Chinese is one quick way they hope to achieve their dreams.

And as African countries add Chinese as a subject on their education curricula, the young people are embracing its learning. In East Africa, Uganda and Kenya have taken the lead.

The Kenya Curriculum Development Institute recently announced that a Mandarin syllabus has been completed and will be rolled out in 2020, staring with primary schools.

In Tanzania, Mandarin is increasingly becoming a common language taught in schools and universities, with many of the country鈥檚 young people enrolling to learn it.

In Uganda, Mandarin was included as a subject on the national school curriculum and starting this February, it is being taught in select public secondary schools across the country 鈥?and by the first set of locally trained Mandarin teachers."
"On December 12, 2063, Kenya will celebrate a 100 years since becoming a republic. It will be 168 years since Britons made Kenya a protectorate and 143 since Kenya became a colony.

It is highly unlikely I will be there to celebrate; my obituary might have been long written. The year 2063 also constitutes the end of African Union (AU) agenda 2063, not as publicised as Kenya鈥檚 Vision 2030.

According to the African Union website, the agenda 鈥渂uilds on, and seeks to accelerate implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development.鈥?It further identifies some past and current initiatives such as the Lagos Plan of Action, Abuja Treaty, Minimum Integration Programme, Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme and the New partnership for Africa鈥檚 Development.

Held hostage

We should not ask loudly why all these past initiatives have not transformed the once dark continent. Could it be that we start one initiative before the other is implemented? Why did President Kenyatta ban new projects before old ones are completed? Coming up with new projects is often about money and outdoing your predecessors. It is also about legacy. It is a problem common in Africa and has held many countries鈥?economic progress hostage.

Let us leave Africa for now and come back home. How will Kenya be by the year 2063? One bold suggestion is that it will have new owners. The indigenous Kenyans owned the country till the Britons came and laid claim. It was easy for them. They had tried that elsewhere, from India to Canada and Australia. They had superior weapons, not just guns but other tools that left us in awe. Think of someone lighting a match box or torch for the first time.

It is still a mystery to me why the British took too long to come to Kenya. Did they fear the mosquitoes? What of the Maasai? Or was there enough space for them in temperate Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa?

Think of it; Britons were in North America by 1620, South Africa by 1820. They were in Australia in 1788 and India in 1757 through company rule before the Crown took direct control in 1858. Remember the Viceroy and Maharajahs of India?

The two world wars seem to have played a role in ushering Britons to East Africa, with former soldiers given land in Kenya as a reward for their success in battle. By the way, one Kanja Kibuku from Ndundori told me of meeting a Kenyan, Mwai Kihiko, in 1959 who had been given land by the British in South Africa after WWII. Anyone heard of him?

Kanja had helped JP Van Rensburg take back his belongings to South Africa after the winds of uhuru started blowing in Kenya. It is an interesting paradox; after running away from black rule in the penultimate years to our independence, the Afrikaans - or better, Boers - finally came under black majority rule in South Africa 31 years later.

We are yet to get a good enough reason why it took so long for the British to take over Kenya, build palatial homes and romanticise their new homes with books like Elspeth Huxley鈥檚 鈥榃hite Man鈥檚 Country鈥? But in no way am I celebrating the coming of mzungu.

Enough digression. Who will be owning Kenya by the year 2063? Long after our feeble bodies have crumbled into dust, to quote Ed Stone one of the scientists working on Voyager, the American project has explored the outer fringes of the universe since 1977.

Let us be blunt; ownership of a country is not just about the land and other physical resources such as houses, cattle, cars or works of art. It also includes the less talked about - our mind, thought process, culture. Ownership includes our identity and even our dreams and aspirations.

Through most of Kenya鈥檚 history, ownership has been seen through the physical lenses with more focus on visible things. That is why we fought for land but not much over our culture or identity. Does it surprise you that some of the most celebrated Mau Mau heroes have foreign names?

Intellectual resources

The less emphasis on non-tangible wealth is best shown by the low number of intellectual resources owned by Kenyans, from books to patents, or even works of art. It should not surprise us. You can drive a new car and everyone will see and hopefully say something good about it. We can comment about your spouse or mpango wa kando, but you can鈥檛 carry your Nobel Prize or degree certificate around to show off your intellectual property. Few will notice your qualifications even on the business card.

Historically, we have fought and died over the tangibles - they define our wealth, status and often power. But ownership of tangible assets and intangible, or soft, assets is often a prerequisite for power. USA has tangible assets from multinational corporations to vast lands but has leveraged on intangible assets such as patents, copyrights, trademarks or even movies that influence our perception of their products and services.

China is following suit by shifting from tangible assets to intangible assets like culture through the Confucius institute. Japan is unique; she never bothered much with intangible assets. Learning Japanese has not fascinated many Kenyans.

Britons had perfected ownership of both types of assets with land, businesses and religion and their culture to match.

Unknown to many, intangible assets are used to shape our views on tangible assets. Think of how religion has shaped your views on wealth, charity and even saving. Think of how education has shaped your views on the same. By the year 2063, the ownership of Kenya鈥檚 tangible and intangible assets and power will depend on a number of key factors.

One is education. Think loudly, the most educated own more property and more influence in Kenya. Through education, lots of Kenyans have moved from rags to riches. But it not just any education, it is the right education. Why have Asians been so successful in Kenya and USA, or even UK? They pursue 鈥渦niversal education鈥? courses that will taken them anywhere in the world. A computer scientist will work anywhere in the world, not a political scientist.

But the most important reason why education will determine who owns Kenya in 2063 is that it is a purveyor of optimism, the 鈥渃an do it鈥?spirit. Children from poor background, who wore shoes for the first time in Form one, became the captains of industry because of the optimism embedded in our education in the past. Today, sadly, education is becoming a purveyor of pessimism. Why else are schools burning?

Some parents long realised the importance of education, good education. That is why academies and high-cost schools are popular; they try to shield kids from pessimism, hopefully without lots of pampering. That education is holistic, going beyond the 鈥渃lutter of inert ideas鈥? It has spiritual, moral and physical values. Noted how good schools are endowed with sports facilities and chapels? Any education reform that does not raise inspirations, optimism of the next generation is not worth the effort.

The ownership in 2063 will also depend on one鈥檚 attitude towards work. Education, sadly, teaches us indirectly to avoid work. Yet, economic progress has always been about work. We all aspire while going through school to one day sit and relax, and earn lots of money while others work. The popularity of higher education is not driven by our love of knowledge, but money that comes with promotion and less work. Graduate students pretend that is not true!

One could ask loudly, who is supposed to work? We never get tired of talking about America鈥檚 protest work ethic. It says work is Godly and Quran seems to support the same view. One of the most common complaints from employers today is that employees do not want to work but want higher salaries, here and now.

The owners of Kenya in 2063 will depend on the results of social engineering, subtle but ongoing. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines social engineering as 鈥渕anagement of human beings in accordance with their place and function in society.鈥?Does that sound familiar? Have you noted how Kenyans are accepting their place in society, even willing to sponsor political dynasties or blame themselves for lack of socio-economic progress? Noted how children from poor background now hate school?

Much easier

With media, social engineering is much easier. Have seen how even simple things like children鈥檚 names have become so uniform? For boys we moved from Kevin to Ian, then Brian, Ryan, Jayden and now Liam. With so much uniformity of thought, it will be easier to have new owners; those motivated to go beyond the call of duty, innovators and risk takers.

New owners of Kenya will emerge because the average Kenyan has been traumatised by past experiences. Even before the traumas of Mau Mau were healed, we got post-election violence, the multiparty, the coalition government, terrorism and repeat elections last year. Some conspiracy theorists opine all these episodes were part of social engineering. The truth might never be known. We continue from there next week.

Ten years ago, President Mwai Kibaki launched an iconic seven-foot statue that was made to relive a revered freedom fighter clasping the nozzle end of a gun with his right hand and a stick on the other, with ruggedness registered all over it.

Today, as feet pace hurriedly up and down the pavements at the intersection of Kimathi and Mama Ngina streets in Nairobi, the statue of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi, killed by the British 60 years ago, has found pride of place among the city鈥檚 landmarks.

Compared to the Tom Mboya monument just metres away, the Kimathi one has not been affected much by human interference.

It is pretty much the full unit that was launched by former president Mwai Kibaki on February 18, 2007.

The Sunday Nation caught up with a man who was part of a team at Kenyatta University (KU) that constructed the statue.

Dr Kamau Wango, currently the director of the Confucius institute at KU, was the peer reviewer of a KU fine art lecturers鈥?team that created the monument.

His work was mainly to ensure the sculpture resembled Mr Kimathi as closely as possible.

CONSULTED KIMATHI鈥橲 WIFE

鈥淵ou have to get the person correct, their face correct, their body structure correct as much as possible because you鈥檙e commemorating somebody who was known,鈥?he said on Friday.

鈥淩emember, there were not very many photos of Kimathi apart from the famous one when he鈥檚 captured. But the team consulted Kimathi鈥檚 wife a great deal. During the process of the construction of that structure, she actually came to KU to be able to look at whether that is her husband,鈥?he added.

Mr Kimathi鈥檚 widow Mukami on Friday launched a memoirs鈥?book titled Mukami Kimathi: Mau Mau Freedom Fighter, written by Wairimu Nderitu, which tells the story of the independence struggle through her eyes.

Dr Wango said when Mukami saw the final creation of her husband鈥檚 statue, she agreed that that was how he looked like.

The statue was made through a complex process that involves moulding the hero鈥檚 shape using clay then generating negatives which then make it possible to use bronze to make the final shape.

鈥淏ronze is a good material because it is very durable. Not only durable but it is good for outdoor display. It is able to withstand all sorts of weather, only that it is just re-touched every once in a while,鈥?said Dr Wango, adding what the Kimathi one may need is a little retouching to restore its shine.

Besides the Kimathi monument, Nairobi has two statues of founding President Jomo Kenyatta 鈥?at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre and at Parliament Buildings 鈥?and that of Tom Mboya near the National Archives building.

OTHER STATUES

Other statues are located along Kenyatta Avenue to commemorate Africans who participated in the First World War and at the Uhuru Park鈥檚 Freedom Corner to commemorate Mau Mau fighters.

There are other statues out of Nairobi which include that of independence hero Paul Ngei that is located in Machakos. It was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in October last year. Another statue of Tom Mboya is erected at the Tom Mboya Labour College in Kisumu.

鈥淭here is no country that is worth itself that does not have certain people that it collectively, as a nation, decide to commemorate,鈥?said Dr Wango, a fine arts expert.

Dr Wango said KU鈥檚 artists won the tender to make the Kimathi statue 鈥?which the State said it cost Sh4.5 million 鈥?probably because the team proved to be the most capable.

鈥淚 think the argument then was that when you have a group of artists together, they are much more able to do good work,鈥?he said.

鈥淚t was constructed at the department at Kenyatta University, and of course there was expertise here and there. What was not available at the university was sourced elsewhere but generally the whole piece was the work of those artists,鈥?added Dr Wango.

The KU team has also constructed the Kenyatta statue outside the university鈥檚 administration block and a statue of rangers at the Kenya Wildlife Services headquarters.

NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 15 鈥?The Chinese Government has expressed confidence in the country鈥檚 development agenda saying the nation has made major strides in infrastructure development.

Speaking Monday during an award ceremony of 20 scholarships to University of Nairobi students drawn from various disciplines, Chinese ambassador to Kenya Liu Xianfa lauded the efforts made by the Jubilee Administration in connecting the country to the national power grid 鈥?saying that the availability of electricity along the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) line will further enhance its efficiency.

鈥淎s you all know, by mid next year you can take a train from here to Mombasa within four hours,鈥?he said. 鈥淏ut after electrification, the speed of the train can easily change from 120kmh to 240kmh 鈥?that means within two hour you can have lunch here (Nairobi) and have dinner in Mombasa.鈥?
According to Liu, the steps taken by the government in improving the county鈥檚 infrastructure will not only create opportunities but also make it easier to clear goods from the port of Mombasa in record time hence decongesting roads.

The Mombasa-Nairobi SGR line which is expected to be complete by June next year has faced numerous challenges among them objections from environmentalist who strongly objected the railway route which will pass over the Nairobi National Park saying it will disrupt the wildlife albeit support from a seasoned conservationist Richard Leaky who ruled out disruptions saying measures had been taken to protect the park.

The other hurdle was the ballooning of land compensation budget which has exceeded the initial amount set aside by the government by 2.8 billion.

The Chinese ambassador however commended the government for its commitment to see that the project is completed in record time saying the efforts put by the state were impeccable.

Liu also lauded the University of Nairobi for strides it had made in the education sector in the region and the continent saying the partnership between China and the university will promote mutual interests that will further development in the two nations.

鈥淭he first Confucius institute in Africa was established at this university and the second in the world,鈥?Liu noted. 鈥淭he Confucius institute in University of Nairobi has now become one of the 15 modern Confucius institutes in the world as well as the only modern Confucius institute in the continent.鈥?
Since its inception in 2013, the Chinese Ambassador鈥檚 scholarship programme has seen 58 students benefit from financial aid with an additional 20 students having benefited from the programme this year.

BEIJING, China, May 29 鈥?China has agreed to support Kenya鈥檚 proposal to upgrade the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to the United Nations Environmental Office in Nairobi, which will be presented to the upcoming Rio +20 World Environmental Conference.

Chinese Vice President Jinping Xi made the declaration after receiving President Mwai Kibaki鈥檚 letter of request from Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, on behalf of Chinese leader Hu Jintao and also advised Kenya to lobby for consensus among key stakeholders.

鈥淲e understand and appreciate the importance that Kenya and the developing world attaches to the presence of UNEP in Nairobi and therefore we will stand with you and only hope that other stakeholders will take a similar position,鈥?said the Chinese VP

The world conference on environment will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, later in June.

During their meeting held at the Great Hall of the People, the two leaders discussed a wide range of issues ranging from the strengthening of the economic ties cultural and economic cooperation and support for Kenya to enhance her security in the face of constant terrorism threats.

Musyoka had earlier met with the Director of the Confucius institute Headquarter HANBAN Ms Xu Lin College and secured the funding and authority to set up a third Confucius institute in Kenya to be established at Egerton University.

The institute will focus on training and transfer of skills in agricultural development. It will also help train Kenyans in Chinese language to provide support services to the tourism industry in face of an expected increase in Chinese tourism arrivals.

In their discussions the two vice presidents reviewed the level of implementation on ongoing projects in Kenya including roads, hospitals and energy projects.

Musyoka took time to impress on his Chinese counterpart on the need for support for Kenya鈥檚 ambitious LAPSET project under Vision 2030, which incorporates the construction of a brand new port in Lamu and linking up of Ethiopia and South Sudan by rail and road.

The Vice President also sought support for building capacity for Kenya鈥檚 police force to handle internal security threats through the setting up of an effective police communication and command centre.

Jinping said Kenya was a central pillar of China鈥檚 policy of political and economic cooperation on Africa and that his country was keen to deepen bilateral relationship between the two countries.

鈥淲e are happy with the economic, cultural and education ties existing between our two nations and we are keen to ensure that this goes stronger and stronger by the day,鈥?said Jingpin.

He said the trade between Kenya and China has crossed 2.5 billion dollars and Chinese investment in Kenya stood at 250 million dollars.

Jinping said that 37,000 Chinese tourists visited Kenya last year and expressed confidence that the figure will rise tremendously in the coming years.

Announcing that he will visit Kenya soon, Jinping said China Southern Airline was set to fly into Nairobi which will present another opportunity for more Chinese to tour Kenya.

On regional and international cooperation, Jinping said China and Kenya usually share a common position.

鈥淚n the aftermath of the world economic crisis, developing countries find themselves confronting even more difficult economic circumstances. China and Kenya should play a more active role in encouraging trade and economic activities that will help- improve the lives of our people,鈥欌€?said the Chinese VP

He congratulated his Kenyan counterpart for the award to him by Nanjing University of Agriculture in China

鈥淭he award reflects the recognition by the Chinese people of your service to Kenyans and for fostering continued friendship between the people of Kenya and the people of China,鈥?said Jinping.

Musyoka said Kenya wanted more Chinese investors in various sectors of the economy in order to spur growth and create jobs for millions of the country鈥檚 youth who enter the labour market every year.

The VP who is accompanied by MPs Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji), Mohammed Sirat (Wajir South) and Charles Kilonzo (Yatta) as well as businessmen David Langat and Vibipul Shah, visited the headquarters of the China Export and Import bank (Exim) and held discussions with its Vice President Zhu Hongjie.

He was briefed that the bank was doing the final assessment before releasing funding for the Kibwezi-Kitui 鈥揗wingi and Usueni road while the Bank was also considering proposals on several major projects in Kenya.

Musyoka heard that the Bank had approved funding for the second phase of Kenya鈥檚 fiber 鈥搊ptic project that will cost 72 million dollars, intended to increase connectivity to the counties."
"Dar es Salaam. Tens of hundreds of local and foreign visitors to the 46th Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF) are flocking to the Chinese pavilion to seek information on a range of products on display.

The Chinese manufacturing, processing, and construction equipment have been getting inquiries from visitors to the pavilion since the trade fair opened its doors on June 28 in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam.

The China pavilion is represented by the East Africa Commercial and Logistics Center (EACLC Limited), a company that promotes business between Tanzania and China. Cathy Wang, director-general of EACLC Limited, said 52 firms from China's Shandong province are accommodated in the pavilion covering 450 square meters.

The China pavilion is showcasing a range of products, including agricultural products, agricultural machinery, garments, construction materials, packaging products, spare parts for vehicles, electronics and furniture, power generators and food processing machines and accessories for motorcycles. All these products are originally produced in Shandong province.

In addition, the China Pavilion has invited the Confucius institute to arrange Chinese lion dance and Chinese kung Fu performances, which attracted a large audience.

Wang said the participation of Shandong companies has been organized by the Department of Commerce of Shandong Province.

""Tanzania-China trade and business relations have improved during the administration of President Samia Suluhu Hassan because of her commitment to the promotion of international relations,"" she said.

According to her, the business climate is booming in Tanzania and the business community from Shandong is looking for a reliable market for equipment in the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction sectors.

""The Shandong Department of Commerce is working on the promotion of domestic entrepreneurs to jointly explore the African market with genuine products. This goes in line with creating a conducive environment for enterprises to grow and offer employment, set up factories and big investments in Africa, particularly in Tanzania,"" she said.

Since it opened its doors, the China pavilion has been visited by a good number of dignitaries, including Tanzania's Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi, former Tanzanian Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda, and Minister of Investment, Industry and Trade Ashatu Kijaji.

According to the Chinese embassy in Tanzania, in 2020, China and Tanzania bilateral trade volume reached 4.58 billion U.S. dollars.

The 46th DIFT which ends on July 13 has attracted 180 foreign companies and 3,200 local firms displaying products, services and technologies used in the production of goods."
"Language is the most important tool in easing communication among people. However, though cooperation and contact between Chinese and Tanzanians has been increasing, the two groups do not know one another language properly.

In most cases, English is used as medium of communication between these two groups. But the situation started to change following establishment of first Confucius institute in Tanzania in 2012, and the direct flight of language was launched.

The Confucius institutes devote itself to satisfying the demands of people from different countries and regions in the world who learn the Chinese language, to enhance understanding of the Chinese language and culture by different people, to strengthen educational and cultural exchange and cooperation between China and other countries, to deepen friendly relationships with other nations, to promote the development of multiculturalism, and to construct a harmonious world.

The Confucius institute provides the following services:

a. Chinese language teaching.

b. Training Chinese language instructors and providing Chinese language teaching resources.

c. Holding the HSK examination (Chinese Proficiency Test) and tests for the Certification of the Chinese Language Teachers.

d. Providing information and consultation services concerning China鈥檚 education, culture, and so forth.

e. Conducting language and cultural exchange activities between China and other countries. The Confucius institute at the University of Dar es Salaam (CIUDSM) was established in October 2013, co-founded by Zhejiang Normal University of China and the University of Dar es Salaam.

Since its establishment, CIUDSM is committed to language teaching as well as providing a platform for cooperation and exchanges in various fields such as education and culture between China and Tanzania.

At present, Chinese is an elective or compulsory course at the University of Dar es Salaam and its teaching centers, CIUDSM started the program of BA of Education (Chinese-English) and Diploma program on Chinese at the University of Dar es Salaam in 2018. In 2019, 10 students received scholarships from the Confucius institute and 21 students received scholarships from the Chinese government.

In 2018, a total of 30 students from CIUDSM received the 鈥淭anzania Chinese Ambassador Award鈥? At present, CIUDSM has 5 local teachers in Tanzania. The local teachers鈥?Chinese classes are very popular among students, and they believe that more Tanzanians will join the Chinese teaching team.

CIUDSM actively sup-ports and participates in the revision of the Chinese language syllabus in Tanzania and jointly develops secondary school examination syllabus of Chinese.

From 2018, except language teaching, CIUDSM cooperate with various institutions in Tanzania to offer different courses, such as the Chinese tourist guide training cooperating with the National Tourism College of Tanzania.

It also co-sponsored the 2018 Tanzania Agricultural Technology Training Course with Tanzania Chinese Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center to help more farmers to grasp the ne agricultural technology.

The books Tanzanian Tourism Chinese, and Tanzania Agricultural Technology Guide, written by CIUDSM, are expected to be published by the end of 2019.In 2019, CIUDSM and the Chongqing Vocational Institute of Engineering in China established the 鈥淟uban Workshop of the University of Dar es Salaam鈥?to provide vocational training opportunities for Tanzanian youth.

This year we have conducted the first term training and sponsored five staff from the College of Engineering and Technology of the University of Dar es Salaam to study in China.

In order to help the people of China and Tanzania exchange and cooperate and promote the friendship between China and Tanzania, the Confucius institute continues to provide Kiswahili language training classes for the Chinese in Tanzania, and requires all Chinese teachers and volunteers of the Confucius institute to actively learn Kiswahili and Tanzanian culture.

Africa needs China, and so does China. The future of China-Africa cooperation is bright, but it is also full of ups and downs. The mission of the Confucius institute is to promote China-Tanzania language and cultural exchanges, to provide a platform and a link for cooperation between China and Tanzania, and to provide services for China-Tanzania cooperation."
"INTRODUCTION

Initial Officer Training Programme (IOTP) provides basic military officer training to Officer Cadets (OCdts) and their equivalents from law enforcement and uniformed services. The programme falls within the tactical level of the Professional Military Education (PME) framework of armed forces and is modelled from the Royal Military Academy Sandhursts鈥?(RMAS) Commissioning Course. It was designed with the direct support and guidance of RMAS Instructing and Support Staff.

Rationale

Traditionally, the Jamaica Defence Force鈥檚 (JDF) longstanding partnerships with militaries across the world has seen its OCdts being trained in academies in the following countries: United States, England, Canada, China and India. Upon the return of OCdts to the JDF, there is a requirement for doctrine and operating procedure standardization due to the varying concepts and differing contents of the training they had undergone. This is normally done at the Unit level and later, through a Young Officers鈥?Course. The advent of COVID-19 added a new level of complexity to travel, thus negatively affecting the process of sending OCdts overseas. Additionally, the ongoing expansion and restructuring of the Force to cauterize the ballooning threats to national security has caused an increased demand for newly commissioned Second Lieutenants.

Due to the carefully adapted military and academic curricula, IOTP serves as the course to treat with the aforementioned considerations. The methodology used addresses each issue directly and the course, through the delivery of a bespoke training syllabus, is fit for the JDF and is also relevant to the militaries and organizations within the Caribbean region and in other parts of the world.

Concept

Having the RMAS approach to training at its core, IOTP is designed with a syllabus that sees male and female integration throughout training. The course focusses on developing military skills and command with a leadership 鈥榞olden thread鈥? The course structure allows the Instructing Staff to educate, build, develop and scrutinize an OCdt鈥檚 ability to decide and communicate accurately and ethically while under pressure and or stress. The expectation is that on commissioning, an OCdt will be fully cognizant of the responsibilities and personal conditions that being an Officer imposes upon them. The product of the IOTP will be an ethical and robust Officer who has the knowledge, skills, attitudes and intellectual agility to adapt their decision-making process and approach to any environment.

Location

The home of IOTP is the Caribbean Military Academy (CMA) Newcastle, which is located at the Newcastle Hill Station, St Andrew, Jamaica.

Nestled in the cool hills of upper St Andrew and amidst beautiful trees, ferns, ground orchids, delicate wild flowers and a profusion of ginger lilies, is the Newcastle

Training Depot founded in 1841 by Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm (later Field Marshall). Gomm, a veteran of the wars against revolutionary France and Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica from 1840 to 1841, relentlessly badgered the War Office in London to establish a mountain station for British soldiers in Jamaica soon after taking up his post.

The idea of the hill station was first raised by Gomm in a letter dated April 7, 1840 to Governor Sir Charles Metcalfe. Gomm pointed out that while Up Park Camp was an ideal location for a barracks, it was subject to the ravages of yellow fever. In Jamaica the

"Shipping line spurns J'can CMI students after colleague implicated in drug bust



Erica Virtue, Senior Gleaner Writer

A cloud of uncertainty is hanging over the heads of Jamaican nationals at the Caribbean Maritime Institute (CMI) as a vast number of students needing seafaring experience to complete requirements of their studies are said to be without attachment to any shipping lines.

The backlog, according to Sunday Gleaner sources, is the end result of a massive drug bust on the shipping line Harren & Partner, which provided seafaring experience for the aspiring sailors.

Massive costs were incurred by the line after a large cache of drugs was found on the ship and a Jamaican student from the institute arrested and sentenced to 10 years on cocaine-related charges.

Venezuelan authorities prevented several officials of CMI and the shipping company from leaving that country for months, at Harren & Partner's expense, until the matter was cleared up.

The situation has strained the relationship between the line and the institute, with Jamaican nationals virtually blacklisted while students from other countries are given preference, Sunday Gleaner sources said.

According to one source, shipping lines with Jamaican students are made to pay high insurance costs in ports of entry, given the greater risk for drug finds on-board.

CMI Executive Director Fritz Pinnock downplayed the situation when he spoke with The Sunday Gleaner following the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the institute and Confucius institute in China to provide Mandarin teachers to the CMI.

""Harren & Partner is a faithful supporter of CMI. They have been here for years. And we can understand that the trade within the Caribbean is under threat because of what is happening globally,"" Pinnock said.

TRADE NOT GROWING

""The drug trade creates all kinds of problems, but 90 per cent of all the containers in the Caribbean go out empty because we have no export. So there is an economic challenge to what we call feeder services like what Harren & Partner provides, because the trade is not growing,"" he said in responding to to the concerns, but without referencing the pile-up of students at CMI.

Continuing, he said: ""As a result, freight rates are higher in the Caribbean and it's a challenge for the line. A lot of what you see happening with the cutbacks on the ships is really because some of the services are not viable.""

Commenting on last year's drug bust, Pinnock said: ""The situation was a very challenging one. You have to understand, you have young people, they come under pressure and we cannot fight that here. So our programmes are geared at student integrity.""

He said the drug bust was the only case in seven years with the shipping line, and ""that's a really unfortunate case. But we are getting support from Harren & Partner in a big way. The services from their tankers which operate in the Far East, we are sending people there. Just today, some people left for there.""

He said Harren & Partner was still taking students from the institute, but The Sunday Gleaner was reliably informed that none of the students were Jamaican nationals.

Students from as far as Israel are registered at the institute.

"INTRODUCTION

Initial Officer Training Programme (IOTP) provides basic military officer training to Officer Cadets (OCdts) and their equivalents from law enforcement and uniformed services. The programme falls within the tactical level of the Professional Military Education (PME) framework of armed forces and is modelled from the Royal Military Academy Sandhursts鈥?(RMAS) Commissioning Course. It was designed with the direct support and guidance of RMAS Instructing and Support Staff.

Rationale

Traditionally, the Jamaica Defence Force鈥檚 (JDF) longstanding partnerships with militaries across the world has seen its OCdts being trained in academies in the following countries: United States, England, Canada, China and India. Upon the return of OCdts to the JDF, there is a requirement for doctrine and operating procedure standardization due to the varying concepts and differing contents of the training they had undergone. This is normally done at the Unit level and later, through a Young Officers鈥?Course. The advent of COVID-19 added a new level of complexity to travel, thus negatively affecting the process of sending OCdts overseas. Additionally, the ongoing expansion and restructuring of the Force to cauterize the ballooning threats to national security has caused an increased demand for newly commissioned Second Lieutenants.

Due to the carefully adapted military and academic curricula, IOTP serves as the course to treat with the aforementioned considerations. The methodology used addresses each issue directly and the course, through the delivery of a bespoke training syllabus, is fit for the JDF and is also relevant to the militaries and organizations within the Caribbean region and in other parts of the world.

Concept

Having the RMAS approach to training at its core, IOTP is designed with a syllabus that sees male and female integration throughout training. The course focusses on developing military skills and command with a leadership 鈥榞olden thread鈥? The course structure allows the Instructing Staff to educate, build, develop and scrutinize an OCdt鈥檚 ability to decide and communicate accurately and ethically while under pressure and or stress. The expectation is that on commissioning, an OCdt will be fully cognizant of the responsibilities and personal conditions that being an Officer imposes upon them. The product of the IOTP will be an ethical and robust Officer who has the knowledge, skills, attitudes and intellectual agility to adapt their decision-making process and approach to any environment.

Location

The home of IOTP is the Caribbean Military Academy (CMA) Newcastle, which is located at the Newcastle Hill Station, St Andrew, Jamaica.

Nestled in the cool hills of upper St Andrew and amidst beautiful trees, ferns, ground orchids, delicate wild flowers and a profusion of ginger lilies, is the Newcastle

Training Depot founded in 1841 by Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm (later Field Marshall). Gomm, a veteran of the wars against revolutionary France and Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica from 1840 to 1841, relentlessly badgered the War Office in London to establish a mountain station for British soldiers in Jamaica soon after taking up his post.

The idea of the hill station was first raised by Gomm in a letter dated April 7, 1840 to Governor Sir Charles Metcalfe. Gomm pointed out that while Up Park Camp was an ideal location for a barracks, it was subject to the ravages of yellow fever. In Jamaica the

""It is a feeling that flows from deep inside,"" says Professor Du Juemin, classical Chinese painter, calligrapher and a poet, as he held his hands out as if to absorb energy fields floating in the air.

The spiritual energies guide Du Juemin, an exponent of the minimalist and the simplistic traditional Chinese painting, to capture life's story in monochrome.

Speaking in Mandarin, his thoughts were translated by Ying Ping Liang, lecturer of Chinese at Confucius institute, University of the West Indies, Mona.

""The use of monochrome is from the Buddhist ideology of minimalism and the fact that all colours evolve from black and white,"" explained Du Juemin, who is visiting Jamaica as artist in residence at Confucius institute.

The neutrality in his works, he said, is a very noble style of painting and a formidable medium of expression.

Du Juemin's paintings are a confluence of visual and written thought process - a symphony of poetry with delicate brush strokes. He says that his paintings carry a message and strive to provoke a thought process among the patrons.

The signature stamps have meanings, and as a Chinese practitioner of art, Juemin is both exponent of painting and calligraphy. ""It is important not only to know how to paint but also to know calligraphy.""

In one of his paintings, a bird is perched on a tree watching the wind blow away the petals of the flowers, which is complemented by a poem which delves into the thought process of the bird, who is wondering why the wind is blowing so hard all night and destroying the flowers and the leaves.

This is a symbolic representation of the advent of autumn.

He also loves to focus on people and nature - from a farmer tilling the land, or village folks doing their daily chores. The life of the common man is encapsulated in his works.

Early-childhood inspiration

His inspiration is embedded since his early memories of growing up in Hangzhou in East China and one of the country's tea-growing regions. The aroma of this brew and the beauty of the 'romantic city' translated into his creative thought process.

""I loved to paint since I was a little boy,"" Du Juemin said. ""There were two reasons that inspired me to do painting - one was the creative and the spiritual process that allows me to express my feelings, and the second, the long lineage of painters who lived in Hangzhou, it was an inheritance of culture of those masters.

""Also in painting I find life, through the brush and the paints,"" he said.

In Chinese painting, traditional brushes are used and paper, which is very delicate. ""The brush strokes have to be very subtle and precise,"" Du Juemin, lecturer at Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, said. ""Any distraction changes the essence of the painting.""

His art has a strong influence and inspiration from the Buddhist philosophy of Zen, the embodiment of deep thinking, which flows from the thoughts expressed by Gautam Buddha, founder of Buddhism. ""Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.""

""Art is the best way to communicate; it has no boundaries,"" Du Juemin says. ""Art is also the best way to keep you company when you are alone, and let your feelings flow.""

"THE Confucius institute (International) was birthed out of China's continued quest to be open and accessible to peoples globally. This openness and accessibility will happen only in such an environment as allows for understanding of an ancient and sometimes mysterious and misunderstood civilisation. As is now known, the Confucius institute at the University of the West Indies was given over during the official visit of Xi Jinping, Vice-President of the People's Republic of China, in February 2009.

My own view on the Confucius institute's relevance is that it ought to function, not only in allowing Jamaicans to understand China, but vice versa. Admittedly, there is a more profound relevance than this. The Chinese have been in Jamaica since that first band of indentured workers set foot on this land in 1854. That they have blended and intermingled with the local population is evident in the many institutions they forged 鈥?the Chinese Benevolent Association, Chinese Cultural Association, Chinese Freemason Association, Chee Kung Tung, the Jamaica China Friendship Association and the Jamaica China Chamber of Commerce. Though imported, the Confucius institute is the most recent institution with relevance to both Jamaica and China. This blending is further evidenced by the presence of various business enterprises, headed by Chinese entrepreneurs, many of whom have done exceptionally well, economically. Some of these individuals continue to make meaningful contributions to the Jamaican society. In truth, a great many can no longer lay claim to a linear ancestry rooted only in China, but have become descendants of those who traversed the Middle Passage, whether as cargo or crew.

As an institution, primarily to educate, the Confucius institute differs from some of the abovementioned in that it was established for native-born and bred Jamaicans, devoid of Chinese ancestry, as well as those bearing Chinese lineage to learn about China. In this sense it is all-embracing. Native Jamaicans, unable to lay claim to Chinese roots, as well as those Jamaicans of Chinese ancestry, continue to find self in that predicament of inability to understand the Chinese. In other words, many Jamaicans of Chinese ancestry themselves know very little of Chinese language/culture, geography or history.

In the 15 months that the Confucius institute has been in operation, we have been able to avail Jamaicans of knowledge, generally, about China. We have celebrated all major traditional Chinese festivals, introduced these into primary and tertiary institutions, as well as to the wider community. Through these festivals and the stories of how they came into existence, Jamaicans have begun to understand their relevance as component parts in that overall Chinese cultural landscape.

The Confucius institute was privileged to have Professor Kung Xiangde of Memphis University, a 75th generation direct descendant of Confucius, deliver our anniversary lecture in February 2011. His topic was 鈥淭he Emergence of China from a Geographic Perspective鈥? He presented an engaging, thorough and timely lecture attended by many people.

There are Jamaicans, both from UWI and the community, who study Chinese (Mandarin) at the Confucius institute. Many of these students are diligent, making the constant effort to master a language that demands attention to detail, time and patience. Out of these classes we have been able to offer scholarships to students to get a first-hand experience of life in China. These have been for short periods of time. While in China they undergo an intensive Chinese language course, interspersed with Chinese Calligraphy, Tai Chi, Chi Gong, and travel extensively within the cities to which they are sent. This 鈥渢ravel鈥?is usually aimed at introducing the history and local culture in those areas. This first-hand experience is valuable for the boldness it engenders in the individual. Usually students return to classes at the institute with a renewed interest to study and improve.

Many individuals continue to support our Film of the Month. These films serve as information, entertainment and art, as they uncover the filmmaker's craft, offer a glimpse on life in China, as well as allow us a different viewpoint on global life 鈥?a global interconnectedness which belongs collectively to Jamaica and China, underpinned by similar emotions, dreams and aspirations. Professor Xie Fei, an award-winning Chinese film-maker, journeyed to Jamaica in March 2011, along with the Beijing Language and Culture University Arts Troupe. He presented his film A Girl From Hunan, while the troupe engaged Jamaicans with song, dance and art.

Within the University of the West Indies itself, the Confucius institute is working, crossfaculty, to promote relationships with institutions of higher learning in China. Valuable contacts are being forged that will not only benefit those in the realm of academia, but Jamaicans in general. I believe that the Confucius institute, which understands China, must play a pivotal role in articulating on behalf of those institutions wishing for some kind of relationship, but are daunted by language or cultural shortcomings.

As we enter the second decade of this 21st century, and the beginning of the fourth decade of China's opening up and Reform Policy, it is quite evident that China can no longer be ignored, whether culturally, economically or politically. For us in Jamaica, whose culture has long been influenced by European and American values, and with whose dominance we always felt relatively comfortable, especially since we understood the language of articulation, we will simply have to learn to change, and change to learn. The US has the largest number of Confucius institutes in the world. This, of course, is not by accident. They understand the value of this institution, and how a grasp of Chinese language and culture will encourage an advantageous position in dealing with China 鈥?this dragon bent on moving the world. This, of course, despite many individuals in the US who continue to label the Confucius institute 鈥渁n instrument for Chinese communist propaganda鈥?

Since I last spoke openly about the Confucius institute at UWI, we have welcomed Professor Lu Shaogang, from Tauyuan University of Technology, as Chinese director, and in October, Mr Zhang Wangxi, a post-graduate student from Shanghai Foreign Studies University, as volunteer.

While the Confucius institute trudges with infant feet, garnering those resources that will make her viable, I encourage Jamaicans to make full use of those services we have to offer. Our sure growth shall be, in part, the mandate of ordinary Jamaican citizens in their willingness to assist in our continued nourishing."
